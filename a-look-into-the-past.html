                            A very close friend of mine currently works for the State Library of Berlin, where she is working
                            for a project called <a href="https://handschriftenportal.de/" target="_blank">Handschriftenportal</a>.
                            It‘s a digital repository of European book manuscripts in German collections, providing a platform for
                            researchers interested in knowledge preserved in medieval and early modern handwritten books. Since then,
                            I‘ve got a lot of pictures of the weirdest (cute!) little illustrations that my friend has found over time—they
                            are marginalia. A year ago, I would have never guessed that there would be a connection between my degree and
                            the screenshots of marginalia from the Middle Ages on my phone. We have not talked about this weird coincidence
                            yet, but I asked her if her more research-focused colleagues have some articles on marginalia they could
                            recommend. They recommended a recent article by Zoe Screti <em>Finding the Marginal in Marginalia</em>, which
                            advocates for the inclusion of recording descriptions of marginalia in catalog entries to empower relevant yet
                            still marginalized voices in the margins.<sup class="footnote-link">17</sup> Screti sums up marginalia's history
                            and recent discourse before advocating for a shift in the current cataloging practice.
                            <sup class="footnote-link">18</sup> Screti defines marginalia as follows:

                            <p>Today, as then, marginalia is used to describe any form of markings (both visual and textual, printed and
                                handwritten) made on a text that are usually—but not always—located in the margins of the said text.

                                I‘m wondering if I should have called my thesis <em>code paratextual
                                materials</em>, this just rolls off the tongue.

                        <p>The word traces its history back to 1640, when it was used for the first time to refer to printed
                            marginal notes that provided additional context to the main text. But the practice of writing in books is
                            much older than the term—before marginalia, it was <em>apostille</em>—deriving from the Latin word
                            <em>postilla</em> for note. Screti notes that marking a book is an active response to what a reader has
                            read. In that way, marginalia leaves a trail of personal thoughts and reactions behind, a document of the
                            dialog between the reader, the author, and the text. For researchers, they are an invaluable resource
                            providing glimpses into the readers and their socio-cultural contexts.<sup class="footnote-link">20</sup> This
                            approach of understanding the socio-cultural contexts
                            through annotations can be traced to the digital with Source Code Criticism, as it employs comparable
                            approaches. Bajohr and Krajewski trace the function of the modern comment through time back to commenting in
                            the legal practice since late antiquity and the theological exegesis—the explanation and interpretation of a
                            text, especially the Bible.<sup class="footnote-link">21</sup> At least for exegesis, this
                            happened—as far as I understood it, in the margins and was also transferred by scribes into later copies of
                            the books. Coming from the digital, it‘s also interesting to read about the shift to the digital in the
                            field of marginalia research. Screti discusses the digital representation of marginalia, mentioning the slow
                            paradigm shift from using the term marginalia to <em>paratextual material</em>, which encompasses the full
                            range of marginal notation. <span class="comment-link c12"></span> Screti also refers to Tatiana Nikolaeva
                            Nikolova-Houston‘s classification of marginalia within hypertext theory and her comparison of the function
                            of marginalia with hyperlinks on websites.<sup class="footnote-link">22</sup> Even
                            though Nikolova-Houston‘s view connects more to hyperlinks than comments, it‘s interesting that there is
                            this overlap in marginalia and HTML. Helen J. Burgess, a media studies researcher, connects marginalia and
                            printmaking to HTML and comments.<sup class="footnote-link">23</sup> Burgess connects the pecia
                            system, which was used in the process of hand copying medieval books<sup class="footnote-link">24</sup>—and the
                            marks the process leaves as marginalia—to HTML
                            marking articles of content and comments.

                                24 The pecia system was a system for efficiently reproducing handwritten in the Middle Ages. Copy
                                texts, so-called exemplars, were loaned out in parts—in piecemeal or Latin pecia, to be copied
                                and then returned. This preserved the quality of the copied books by limiting errors. With this
                                system, multiple workshops worked on one copy of a book, which meant there was a need for
                                communication between all the different people. Pecia marks were the solution to this problem,
                                as they marked where the different pieces of hand-copied text (pecia) would be placed in the new
                                copy of the book. In: Dilger, Bradley J., and Jeff Rice, eds. <em>From A to &lt;A&gt;:

                                When I look around both physically and digitally, I‘m surrounded by comments and notes.
                                Currently, I’m writing at a desk in my living room—it‘s close to 8pm. I’m nearly done for today, and I
                                am fried. On my left is a jumble of notes—random thoughts on paper while I’m not at my computer; a
                                Kaufland receipt with notes from one of my flatmates, who took the time to listen to me while I had my
                                first (hopefully last) meltdown about this thesis and later helped me with structuring; a few mind maps
                                trying to conjure a semblance of a common thread through my thoughts into this text; lastly two Kimchi
                                recipes. In my writing environment, a few sources are currently open as tabs, and my random thoughts
                                about the process of writing this text, how the website and the print version will look, are going
                                either into this text itself, my documents called thoughts and design &amp; writing.

                            For her, comments share formal similarities to pecia marks, as they are both marking articles and
                            spaces for content. Same as Bajohr and Krajewski, Burges draws a parallel between comments and exegesis. For
                            her, these aspects of explanation and interpretation are the key differences to pecia marks. Comments as
                            literary devices seek to explain what will happen when code is performed—they are a companion to code and a
                            tool for communication with other people.<sup class="footnote-link">25</sup> In
                            this sense, she aligns with the values of <em>Literate Programming</em>. All these
                            perspectives reaffirm to me a deep connection between comments and marginalia. On the one hand, both have
                            similar functions in the field of annotations—especially if one considers commentaries as paratextual
                            material, where I understand the textual as code. On the other hand, through the connection between
                            comments, in this case as a form of literary criticism - not code comments, as seen in exegesis and law,
                            marginalia, in which most of them take place,<sup class="footnote-link">26</sup> and
                            the modern comment - the one in code - which can trace its history back to literary comment. When I look at
                            the relation between <a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/466179" target="_blank">this
                            commentary in the margins and the text it is commenting on</a>, it gives me such Literate Programming vibes.

                            Going back to Bajohr and Krajewski and their short summary of the history of the comment, they
                            also shine a light on comments in editorial philology<sup class="footnote-link">27</sup> to
                            review the comment as a tool for reflection through the lens of Source Code Criticism. They emphasize the
                            cognitive gap between text and comment and the automatic change of perspective one can get from crossing
                            this gap. This continuous change of perspective creates a distance to the subject matter and serves as a
                            means of self-reflection and critical examination of the writing process.<sup class="footnote-link">28</sup> I
                            think this mechanism also applies outside of Source Code
                            Criticism. I often feel like this while writing comments to myself while coding or, in this case, writing.
                            When coding, I tend to write what I want the function to do as a comment before and iterate between code and
                            text while coding and adding or editing comments and notes. Sometimes, I also write paper notes because I
                            feel that the motion of handwriting helps me more than typing the same thought—or it won‘t come out unless
                            I‘m writing by hand.<span class="comment-link c13"></span>

    ah yes, sub chapters, first i thought it will be fine to leave it as one cohesive block, but i think
    I want to chage the background gradients, or do something to make them a bit more distinct, but still
    cohesive. also! this will need seperate tables. and new articles for each subchapters. gonna try this now

                            Mixing and matching whatever medium to record a thought or leave a note feels close to how I
                            perceive the transition from handwritten comments for code to digital comments in code. I was vaguely aware
                            of punch cards, but with how coding works now, the early era of computing feels so far away. The first
                            general-purpose electronic computer was the ENIAC. The purpose and associated development of this computer
                            were ballistic calculations for the US military - it was therefore used to calculate the trajectories of
                            artillery and missiles so that they would not miss their targets. Like many technical inventions that we
                            rely on today, the computer too began as a project of the military-industrial complex.

                                think it‘s good to already have this information in the main text—even though I will have a deeper dive
                                into this topic in the following chapter.

                            The ENIAC was operated with knobs, plugboards, and an external memory with punch cards. The
                            program had to be written on a piece of paper and then translated into binary for the machine to understand
                            and input into the different parts of the computer by turning the right knobs, plugging cables into the
                            plugboards, and ingesting punch cards.<sup class="footnote-link">29</sup> These crucial and
                            complicated steps for operating this computer were performed by women—called the ENIAC Girls, who were

                            In this era of handwritten or typewritten code, I wonder how many notes and comments were written
                            down on paper—part code, part notes, and scribbles. I imagine little reminders and drawings for remembering
                            the specific quirks of this machine, notes to self, and notes to others. Scribbles, crossed-out errors, or
                            rewritten letters and numbers because they were not readable enough. Notes to help with figuring out how a
                            specific program should work and notes for the conversion to binary. Notes and markings on specific punch
                            cards and maybe even comments on the final versions of binary instructions.<sup class="footnote-link">31</sup>
                            All of this happens in the margins of the instructions fed
                            to ENIAC to perform code. I think that was a time when comments could be considered marginalia in the

                                It was so hard to grasp how early computing with knobs, switchboards, and punchcards worked.
                                In the beginning, I had no idea how code would be transferred to something like a punchcard or tape
                                because all the literature I read assumed knowledge about this process. So, I turned to Science YouTube
                                for help and was rewarded. I’m such a sucker for good science communication. After binging a lot of
                                different YouTube videos and taking notes, I’m glad I finally have a rough overview of the history of
                                computing - even if it’s just through the lens of comments. At the beginning of my research, I focused
                                more on the social aspect of coding. Still, I realized that I really have to get to know the basics of
                                the technical aspect of these early computing technologies to understand how this transition from paper
                                to digital came and how comments transitioned in this period.

                            Coding was very tedious and challenging in this era of computing. Over the coming decades, new
                            approaches and ways of programming were found step by step, which also transformed the form of comment. With
                            the change from binary <em>machine language</em> to the first level of abstraction <em>assembly

                            I present to you a brief summary of the history of computers from the perspective of the comments.
                            Throughout researching this transition period<sup class="footnote-link">35</sup> and
                            getting to know all these different technologies, I’ve noticed that even though the hardware changes over
                            time, the programming languages and their features are always the ones that are supported on the devices.
                            So, the focus through all these iterations of computers and storage media lies on the language of code and
                            the human element, not necessarily the device. Nevertheless, the devices are still important in
                            understanding this transformation process, as these devices determine the medium on which writing takes
                            place—initially analog and later digital. In the 1950s—the era of ENIAC and its successor devices—computers
                            used different media for storing and loading programs or code. These were knobs and switches, plugboards
                            with cables, paper tape as well as punch cards. The basic workflow from coder to computer was the following:

                                    editor today. The code would have been in Assembly or, later, a high-level programming language. If
                                    you write code for the ENIAC, you will have to translate the code into Machine Language by hand.

                                    been a plugboard, where you connect outputs to each other with cables. The third way was punch cards

                            This process did not change much between the different programming languages. While writing code,
                            there was always space for comments, notes, or scribbles on the paper—it did not depend on the language, and
                            all code was prewritten on coding forms. The early high-level languages like FORTRAN<sup
                                class="footnote-link">36</sup> and COBOL<sup class="footnote-link">37</sup> had
                            the option to also write comments directly in the code by marking the line with the right symbol. These
                            could also be encoded onto the punch cards, with the additional option of commenting out any line of code
                            afterward by punching out a certain field on the card. The whole punch card would be treated as a
                            comment—irrelevant to the machine but still an integral part of the order of the punch card stack. In a way,
                            the comment could be transferred from the margins of the coding form to a new state. It would be embedded in
                            the code's main text but still retain its status as an outsider, as it would not be seen as relevant for
                            part of the code's readership - the machine.<sup class="footnote-link">38</sup>

                                38 With this in mind, I‘m wondering if everything that was printed on a punch card—be it the
                                numbering, logos, or, in general, anything that was not the punched hole, could be considered
                                something akin to comment or marginalia from the perspective of the machine.

                            Going back to the setting of the 1940s, when computing was getting started, women were mostly
                            relegated to clerical positions like human data processing or execution, with men being in charge of the
                            research and development of this new technology. It wasn’t any different with the ENIAC. The women who
                            worked on this project set up the machines and should simply implement the instructions of the male
                            planners. They were at the bottom of the hierarchy of intellectual and professional status. Yet the process
                            of translating the instructions into machine code and inputting them into the machine turned out to be not a
                            simple operation. It required innovative thinking and new approaches developed by the female coders. What
                            was thought to be a straightforward process of coding an algorithm turned out to be a multi-layered process
                            of analysis, planning, testing, and troubleshooting. They had to fight for the acknowledgment of their
                            insights and improvements in computing. The so-called <em>ENIAC Girls</em> were unknown and not recognized
                            for their contributions for a long time.<sup class="footnote-link">46</sup> These
                            and later many other women in similar positions were a crucial part of this part of computing history, with
                            many becoming programmers. This left the programming field in a somewhat uncertain position regarding the
                            social status connected to the works. Both men, who came from high-status research jobs, and women from
                            low-status clerical positions became programmers. At the same time, the field began the professionalization
                            process to become a high-status discipline. Until the 50s and 60s, the programming profession was still
                            relatively open to women compared to other occupations in the same period, but the advancing
                            professionalization changed this.<sup class="footnote-link">47</sup> This professionalization is
                            a central aspect of the masculinization of programming. Ensmenger refers to Margaret Rossiter and others who
                            have suggested that the process of professionalization is deeply rooted in the exclusion of women.

                            To improve the status of the disciple, the often feminized aspects of low-status work had to be
                            excluded from the profession. In addition, a prerequisite level of higher education makes access to the
                            profession more difficult. This made it disproportionally hard for women to enter the profession—especially
                            when also encumbered by the role of mother and or wife.<sup class="footnote-link">48</sup>
                            Professionalism also implies a level of authority and expertise—qualities that haven’t been associated with
                            femininity.<sup class="footnote-link">49</sup> Ensmenger attributes
                            pressure for increasing professionalization to the following key reasons. The software industry of the 1960s
                            was in great need of programmers as the computerization of business was rapidly expanding. With a shortage
                            of programmers, they started to become highly sought-after workers with an increased status in their
                            jobs.<sup class="footnote-link">50</sup> This, however, collided
                            with the managerial class of workers, as they felt threatened in their positions. In the eyes of managers
                            and office workers, unruly and unpredictable programmers had to struggle to find their place in the company
                            hierarchy.<sup class="footnote-link">51</sup> The way I read it,
                            professionalizing programming was a way of standardizing this new group of workers. To make them more
                            predictable and cost-efficient and to integrate them fully into the established system without endangering
                            the existing corporate structures.

                            One way companies tried to select the people for the job of programmer was by testing programs for
                            new employees. These programs often included pseudoscientific aptitude tests and personality profiles. They
                            included a focus on mathematic skills or a formal education in mathematics, which was even disproven when
                            these tests first appeared and favored antisocial men with an interest in mathematics—the detached male
                            programmer.<sup class="footnote-link">52</sup> The goal of those testing
                            programs for companies was to transition from dependence on the few highly skilled programmers to a larger,
                            less skilled workforce, where each programmer is interchangeable.<sup class="footnote-link">53</sup> With this
                            systematic preselection for a particular type of
                            man to be a programmer, the stereotype of the antisocial, male, mathematics-inclined programmer came to be
                            in the 1960s and was embraced by men as a self-ascription of the profession.<sup class="footnote-link">54</sup>
                            With the increasing masculinization of the field, behavior
                            patterns took root, whose impact I can still feel today. The idea of real programmers who work on real
                            computers with genuine programming languages. They understand the computer and think in machine code. They
                            don’t need easy programming languages because they are just that good with code. No one else can probably
                            understand their code because it’s just too clever and exploits the hardware on a fundamental level.<sup
                                class="footnote-link">55</sup> The rudeness and antisocial behavior are what makes them a
                            good programmer—no bullshit, just objectively superior code. And in comparison to men, who are born
                            programmers with their logical thinking and problem-solving nature, women just can’t compete because they
                            are out of their element.<sup class="footnote-link">56</sup> Glory to the male genius!<span class="comment-link c17"></span>

                            Until I got into coding, I was still pretty naive about this, if I’m honest. I remember one of my
                            first thoughts about this was: <em>How do people who don’t speak English or use a keyboard with a Latin
                            alphabet actually code? Yeah, you will probably just use your specific character set, and it will work
                            somehow.</em> This idea of universal language and character support was shattered as I realized how
                            people in our class would switch their keyboard from their native layout, like Hangul, to English. I
                            realized quickly that there is basically only English in the commercialized world of coding. There are, in
                            comparison to the totality of all programming languages, a few that are non-English. Still, many of them are
                            either not really compatible, proof of concepts, or for educational purposes.<sup class="footnote-link">62</sup>
                            Besides these very few non-English programming languages, the only other exceptions are <em>esoteric languages</em>. 
                            They are more akin to artistic endeavors probing
                            the boundaries of what a programming language can be.<sup class="footnote-link">63</sup> The
                            programming languages I and many others use to make websites are only available in English.<sup class="footnote-link">64</sup>
                            <span class="comment-link c18"></span>This bias is also prevalent in the input devices we use. Even my German
                            qwertz layout is not really that nice for coding. Many of the characters I have to use are hidden behind
                            different combinations of control, shift, and option, whereas they are way more accessible on an English
                            qwerty layout. Plenty of people I know switched permanently to the English layout because of coding.

                            As Marino puts it, the choice to base programming languages on one specific natural language has
                            significant implications for everyone interacting with it. It can have colonizing effects on non-native
                            speakers, and every programmer who is not a native speaker is at a disadvantage in the computational
                            economy, as they don’t have the same connection to the different tokes or syntax adopted from the natural

                            not neutral or unbiased—they are an interwoven mess of the social conditions they emerged from, their
                            integration into the capitalist system and patriarchal structures, characterized by displacement,
                            exploitation, demarcation, and the continuous development in these conditions.<sup

                            With the web, I see history repeating itself to a certain degree. The technical foundation for the
                            Internet was built as a US military project for distributed communication in the 1960s called ARPANET.
                            First, in the US, later in Europe and other countries, similar networks were established between
                            universities for research purposes.<sup class="footnote-link">67</sup> The World Wide Web, or the
                            Internet as we know it today, got its start in 1989 at CERN<sup class="footnote-link">68</sup>; yet
                            again, it is an overwhelmingly male story.<sup class="footnote-link">69</sup> From
                            the original proposal, the web didn’t take long to take off.<sup class="footnote-link">70</sup>            
                            <span class="comment-link c19"></span> Cyberspace promised to be full of new possibilities—potentially for
                            everyone. The utopian cyberfeminist visions of completely redefining yourself and leaving markers like race,
                            gender, and class behind stayed a vision<sup class="footnote-link">71</sup>. Yet
                            again, the web was positioned as part of masculine culture through its closeness to technology and computer
                            science. However, positions such as <a href="https://cyberfeminismindex.com/" target="_blank">cyberfeminism</a>
                            have been criticizing and working against these circumstances since the beginning<sup class="footnote-link">72</sup>, as
                            have art movements such as net-art<sup class="footnote-link">73</sup> and electronic
                            literature<sup class="footnote-link">74</sup>, which also overlap with
                            cyberfeminism to some extent and also break open what the web, websites, and web-code can be. Parallel to
                            this early period, characterized by curiosity and hobbyism, the web was beginning to be monetized and was
                            fully integrated into capitalism by the 2000s and the bursting of the dot-com bubble. In its current form,
                            the Internet largely exists as an entry point for walled gardens run by big tech fighting for our precious
                            attention and data, as well as the technical backbone of the platform economy at large to slowly commoditize
                            every aspect of our existence.<sup class="footnote-link">75</sup> Somehow, I still love the
                            Internet, at least when I look at the communities existing in resistance to those forces building a web that
                            is not following the path of monetization, like the <a
                                href="https://www.are.na/kristoffer-tjalve/poetic-web-calendar" target="_blank">poetic

                            But what about the comment? On the web, you can see the source code of a website quite easily
                            compared to other software, like the browser itself. The inspector in modern browsers and the view source
                            function display a website’s HTML code and provide access to the CSS and JavaScript files a website uses.
                            With this, I can look through the web code and all the comments left behind. With so much of the code behind
                            software hidden or inaccessible, I wondered why every modern browser would happily show me everything it
                            could. This can be traced back to the early 1990s and early browser development when developers realized
                            that this could be a fun feature to let people see the website’s code as it was sent to the browser either
                            way to render the website. With <span class="comment-link c20"></span> view source, every website became an 
                            opportunity to experiment and learn
                            from—web code became accessible and easily sharable.<sup class="footnote-link">76</sup> In the
                            mid-2000s, the modern integrated web inspector was created. There were different tools with similar
                            functions as stand-alone applications available; building on that, a Firefox plug-in Firebug and the Web
                            Inspector for Safari unified all of the different aspects in 2006 into tools that worked inside the browser.
                            Firebug focused more on debugging JavaScript, while Web Inspector, on the other hand, prioritized viewing
                            source features more. Over time, all browsers adopted the inspector with more or less the same features.

                                I want to elaborate more on my position on frameworks, especially template builders. With
                                frameworks targeted at web developers, I think it’s great that there are tools that make web development
                                easier or, in many cases, web app development. At the same time, I’m thinking about the reasons for
                                streamlining these processes, and I believe that, in many cases, it can be summarized as optimizing
                                because of market pressure. If the trade is sacrificing the understandability and accessibility of code
                                and, by proxy, reducing the potential agency of people interacting with a given website for economic
                                benefit, I really think it’s a bad trade. A trade all of us have to make, but nevertheless, a trade we
                                are somewhat forced to make due to our economic circumstances or market pressure in general.

                                Edit: I could not find a good spot to discuss code minification, so it’s also here.
                                Similar to frameworks, code minification is also a way to optimize web code. It compresses
                                the code by removing all <em>unnecessary</em> characters. This loads the JavaScript faster but makes the
                                code unreadable unless it is somehow reworked. Even in that case, all original variable names, comments,
                                etc., are wholly lost. When thinking about optimization in this case, I wonder for whom something is
                                optimized? Certainly not you and me.

                            I think the rise of the inspector and JavaScript debugging tools coincides with the rise of the
                            platforms<sup class="footnote-link">78</sup> and web2.0 in general, with
                            many websites focussing on user-generated content and the websites growing ever more complex. For a big part
                            of the web, you can still peak at what is happening, but you don’t get the full picture anymore. As Burgess
                            explains with php. The browser still displays the HTML as the end result, but nobody can see the code for
                            everything that happens on the server, like fetching specific data from a database to build the HTML.<sup
                                class="footnote-link">79</sup> With ever more users on websites like Facebook, Twitter, or
                            Youtube, a growing tech stack to manage and optimize these platforms, and progressing monetization, these
                            websites transform into closed-down applications running on the web. This is also the time of a paradigm
                            shift for the web at large. It moves away from an ethos of sharing code to build your own web to one of
                            proprietary code only seen because of the technological remnants of early web history. For me, the rise of
                            JavaScript frameworks like React or Vue since the 2010s,<sup class="footnote-link">80</sup> as
                            well as the increase of template builder websites,<sup class="footnote-link">81</sup> are
                            symptomatic of this shift, as they streamline the process of making websites and web apps but sacrifice the
                            accessibility and understandability of the code while visiting the website.

                            For me, apps of websites on the phone and mobile browsers represent the endpoint of this
                            obfuscation process. Apps transform the original websites into fully closed pieces of software, removing
                            them entirely from any ethos of interacting with the code, while mobile browsers take away all options for
                            viewing source code and interacting with code in general. Reading about trend forecasts predicting that the
                            majority of people connecting to the Internet already experience it exclusively via their mobile 
                            devices,<sup class="footnote-link">82</sup> I really wonder if the idea of making a website something
                            that is not mediated through a service is already a thing of the past which only a few lost souls, i.e., web
                            designers cling on—so me and maybe you.

                            For whom am I making websites, and why?<br>
                            Am I a service as well?

                            I know why I make websites—it’s fun, and I really enjoy every aspect of making them. The whole
                            process is very personal, which is important to acknowledge. Most personal or professional websites I have
                            made have been designed and programmed by me alone. The few times I collaborated with others, the process
                            was either split between design and programming, or it was close to two people designing and coding on one
                            device. I like to work on things where the project scope stays somewhat small and, to a certain degree,
                            personal. I like collaborating with others, but I don’t enjoy being part of a bigger system where I can only
                            do specific tasks regarding design or programming. I want to have a bond with the things I make and spend so
                            much time with.

                                Website template builders, which are used by regular people, designers, and developers, are
                                good things by themselves. The ability of tools to assist people who are not able to code when making
                                websites is wonderful. I think that creating websites and web-based art is not inherently connected to
                                the ability to code, and websites or web-based art is not in any way worse than if it had been coded. At
                                the same time, I think the ability to code opens other avenues to understand the medium of websites,
                                which may be specific to code and are worth exploring. My main issue with the current system and
                                specifically the business model of template builders is the shift from tool to closed ecosystem service.
                                If I can use a website builder as a tool, that‘s great! If it locks me into a system with limited
                                options and a monthly subscription fee, where I cannot leave without losing my website—not great. On top
                                of that, the generated HTML code has the same issue as the code generated by frameworks, as the
                                potential agency is turned into higher profit margins.

                                This is the first time I’ve experienced this with a medium.
                                As I did a lot of 3D and regular graphic design before making websites, I was always surrounded by
                                digital files. But so much was unseen, with a disconnect between the final object and the process of
                                making it. Having 100 GB of files as the process was reduced to a single JPEG object somehow always felt
                                weird.

                            For me, this applies to both personal and professional projects. When being compensated for making
                            a website, I’d rather like the website to be a record of a collaboration, a bond, than a service I provide.
                            I want to move away from the notion of the clean, effortless final product that appears out of thin air to
                            be consumed. I want my websites to be imbued with their history—to be both a completed object and the
                            process itself. I realized that this dual nature is why I like the medium of the website so much. Be it on
                            the Internet or even as a local HTML file.<span class="comment-link c22"></span> For me, this duality of object and process translates to the split between the website
                            that exists due to the code being performed and the code that is performed for the website to exist.
                            Switching between these two very different layers and experiences opens up somewhat of a place for me. I can
                            experience the same thing in two different Modi, with potentially very different types of material, without
                            them interfering negatively. If I’m interested in taking a peek behind the curtain, I’m allowed to—I love
                            that curiosity is rewarded.
