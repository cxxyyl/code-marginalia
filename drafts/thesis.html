        <p><mark>I’m thinking about which language to use to write this whole thing. My literature is mixed,
                and my notes are all over the place. I’m asking friends for opinions on this. I think my English is
                okay, but I could probably express myself better in German. But my gut is telling me, “Oh, it’s web/code
                related, so I guess English it is.” Let’s hold this thought; it will reappear later.</mark></p>
        <p><mark>I’ve been thinking a lot about the tone of this thesis. Thinking back to the last thesis I
                wrote, it had to have this scientific, neutral tone. In my previous thesis, I had to adopt a tone that
                was objective, devoid of personal emotions, and focused on presenting facts and analysis. With the HFBK
                and the freedom it offers to write my thesis, I’m pretty happy, as I want this to be more personal than
                I had the chance to do before.</mark></p>
        <p>As always, it all comes back to childhood fears, but let’s start with the present. In a way, all
            of this feels quite Freudian. With me joining Klasse Digitale Grafik, I honestly did not think I’d end up
            coding. I originally joined because of my interest in graphic design and my general interest in topics
            related to the Internet. I knew coding was a part of this class, but I never thought I would develop such an
            interest in the subject of code—primarily because my emotional connection to code used to be one of fear.
            Over the last few years, I gradually managed to overcome this deeply rooted fear of coding. The more I
            overcame it, the more fun I started to have while coding my small little websites. With this, which feels
            like a generic progression for a person learning a new skill, I became more interested in how other websites
            were made. With this, my descent into the rabbit hole of web programming started to accelerate, and I think
            I crossed a point of no return with coding.</p>
        <p>One of my first PC memories is sitting in front of the family PC running Windows 98, doodling in
            Paint. I don’t have any recollection of surfing the web at this age. This changed when I got my first Laptop
            in 2002—I was 10 or 11 years old at that point. <mark>I’ve just talked to my dad about it—unlike me, he has
                a good memory. He bought the Laptop on sale at a Real near Berlin in 2002.</mark> With this, I also got
            my own connection to the Internet at some point, probably by still plugging a cable from the router into the
            LAN port of my Laptop. With a personal device and a connection to the Internet, I was well on my way to
            becoming a very online teen. With the spread of social media and microblogging in the mid-2000s, I had a
            cringy MySpace page and was later very active on Tumblr. Both sites allow you to customize your page or
            blog.<sup><span class="footnote-link">[1]</span></sup> I really enjoyed all the
            creativity people had with styling and personalizing their little web spaces, yet I never did that because I
            was terrified of coding. With MySpace, I’m not so sure how I customized it anymore, but like Tumblr, it also
            had a <a data-tooltip-position="top"

                editor.</a> With Tumblr, however, I vividly remember this moment of opening the custom CSS panel many
            times and closing it again and again in fear. Ultimately, I always used themes—not that this is bad or worse
            in any way than doing it yourself. However, it had somewhat of a sour aftertaste for me because I always
            wanted to make my own stuff but could not out of fear and feelings of inadequacy. While researching this
            thesis and thinking about my relation to code, many memories from my childhood and early teens came back. I
            remembered why I used to be so afraid of coding—it was the <em>Informationstechnischer Grundkurs</em> I had
            in 2005, which was seventh grade.</p>
        <p><mark>These are moments where I’m glad I kept all my old school reports. It seems like I finished
                the course with a grade of 2 (B), which surprised me because I managed to partake in it and get a good
                grade. Moments like these remind me that my memories are nothing more than canonized fanfiction of
                myself. Out of interest, I looked at the state of the school’s website from when I was attending seventh
                grade. My old school seemed to go through at least three different domains and had multiple domains
                running in parallel. <a data-tooltip-position="top"

        <p>I remember being taught VBA Basic, HTML with CSS, and using CorelDraw to make graphics for the
            website. The only other thing I remember is constantly feeling too stupid to program. “I’m not good enough
            at maths or logical thinking to understand what happens when I type things into the computer.” I was so
            happy once this course was over, and at that point, it was very clear to me that I was just too stupid to do
            anything with the web and coding in general. Looking back on this episode of my life and reevaluating this,
            I can see that is not true at all.</p>
        <p>Berlin had a school reform in 2003, which mandated that every school had to have a focus. Our
            school chose a media focus and had to scramble together an informatics teacher and a course. We were the <a
                data-tooltip-position="top"
                aria-label="https://web.archive.org/web/20040208140124/http://www.lilienthal-og.de:80/seiten/ITG/itg.html"

                target="_blank">second year</a> where this course was thought, so everything was still pretty rough. If
            I remember correctly, the guy who taught us was also the web admin for the school website and not a regular
            teacher at my school. With me now having been part of a few coding workshops and gaining some teaching
            experience, I realize that this whole course was not a good way to introduce new students to coding. So, all
            in all, many different random factors came together. My first year in a new school environment, me being a
            very angsty and sensitive kid, a school reform that introduced the <em>Informationstechnischer
                Grundkurs</em> the year before, and we were still being guinea pigs for this new curriculum.</p>
        <p>After this somewhat traumatic first encounter with code, I was convinced I was too stupid to code
            because it’s something only smart or STEM people can do—which sadly is a widespread belief held by people
            inside and outside the coding field. Although I was socialized as a boy and was a somewhat geeky teen, which
            was at least stereotypically a prerequisite for becoming part of the coding subculture, I never became a
            part of it and developed in a different direction.</p>
        <p>Besides fear, the bad vibes I felt as a teen were another significant factor in why I never really
            became part of the male-dominated geek culture. Later, I would learn the concepts to understand what these
            bad vibes were—sexism, elitism, racism, anti-queerness, toxic masculinity, to name a few. I was mainly on
            Tumblr but occasionally visited places like <em>Something Awful</em> or <em>4chan</em> to see what was
            happening in the abyss. When <em>Gamergate</em> happened in 2014, the hate reached my bubble of depressed,
            internet-obsessed, queer young adults on Tumblr almost instantly and radicalized me in my beliefs. Since
            then, I had a somewhat split perception of the Internet. I was part of heavily online communities that could
            make their own Internet to a certain degree, even if that was impossible for me personally. <mark>Sadly, I
                never discovered net art at that point in time, which probably would have changed a lot for me.</mark>
            With the preconception that many people who could make websites or the Internet at large were part of a
            group of people I was at odds with and my general fear of code, the idea of making the Internet was very far
            away. Yet, I ended up coding and love making websites.</p>
        <p>With my coding skills improving over the last two years, <mark>I still feel stumbling
                around.</mark> I’m now at the point where I have somewhat of a praxis or at least ideas about what I am
            doing with the medium website, how I am engaging with it, and what I want to do with it moving forward. For
            me personally, this has had an impact on the way I program, albeit subconsciously until recently. While
            searching for a topic for my thesis, I began realizing that many of the things I’m drawn to in coding are,
            in a way, a reconciliation with past fears of my childhood self.</p>
        <p> <mark>I am struggling with organizing the next block of ideas. There are many somewhat related
                things, but I’m wondering what to include. Now, two days later, I think I have worked out everything. I
                had to rethink the structure of the text, but now I think I’m quite okay with the structure. Thank you
                to all who supported me emotionally and in terms of content.</mark></p>
        <p>I like websites with a certain warm feeling—a sort of personal character. This can apply to design
            and content, as well as to code or how they were made. The aspect of how it’s made started to become more
            pronounced the more I could code. With this, I also realized I wanted the code side of the website to have a
            warm and inviting feeling, as this was something I had feared and distanced myself from for such a long
            time.</p>
        <p>A feeling that peeking behind the curtain of design is welcome and encouraged. Like the website
            that invites you in so you can spend some time with it. Or maybe like a connection to the person or people
            who made the website by encountering artifacts they left behind—by chance or by purpose. <mark>I really love
                the idea of the site spirit on <a data-tooltip-position="top"
                    aria-label="https://polinsski.digitale-grafik.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link"
                    href="https://polinsski.digitale-grafik.com/" target="_blank">polinsski’s</a>current website. It
                reminds me of Tsukumogami in Japanese Folklore; they are tools that have acquired a soul after being
                used for 100 years and cause mischief if they haven’t been properly cared for. A sort of fictional
                anthropomorphization of the website or a form of world-building or storytelling that happens.</mark></p>
        <p>Most websites I visit outside big platforms, like social media or video streaming services, are
            made by a single person or a tiny group of people. I enjoy getting to know these strangers, who also like
            making websites just by visiting the spaces they created. So, I want the same to be true when someone visits
            one of the websites I made. When I leave or encounter messages, notes, explanations, or other artifacts in
            the code of a website, they are comments. It’s one of the few ways to leave text in code that is not code
            itself. So, over the last few years, the comment grew very close to my heart, and in a way, I’m dedicating
            this text to you, dear comment. To get to know you better, understand you more, learn about your history,
            how you’re used, and what you mean to me. So I welcome you, dear reader, to go on this journey with me.</p>







            
        <h1 data-heading="What are you, dear comment?">What are you, dear comment?</h1>
        <p>I like the definition of a comment in Markus Krajewski’s text <em>Kulturtechnik
                Programmieren</em>, as it is close to how I feel about it. He talks about the two layers of code. The
            first layer is the instructions, which are executed by the machine. This is the actual code or text written
            in a programming language. The second layer is marked text that is not executed. This piece of text is
            ignored by the machine.<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-2-bf2b2f0b474854b2" class="footnote-ref"
                id="fnref-2-bf2b2f0b474854b2"><span class="footnote-link">[2]</span></sup> It can be text, code, a mix,
            or something like ASCII art. Either way, it does not matter to the machine but to us as readers. To make a
            comment or mark text so it will not be executed, you will have to use a specific string of symbols to let
            the program know what follows will be a comment. Here is a small example with HTML<sup
                data-footnote-id="fnref-3-bf2b2f0b474854b2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-3-bf2b2f0b474854b2"><span
                    class="footnote-link">[3]</span></sup>.</p>
        <p>
            <code>&lt;p&gt; This is a tag used in HTML to define a paragraph of text. What follows below is a comment&lt;/p&gt;</code>
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>&lt;!-- In HTML, you use this combination of symbols to declare a comment. Everything inside here will not show up when you normally view a website. --&gt;</code>
        </p>
        <p>There are two ways to format a comment: block and inline. A block comment is comparable to a
            paragraph of text with one or multiple line breaks. This would be used for a longer comment. Compared to
            this, an inline comment is shorter and spans only one line. Here is a quick example of those two types of
            comments.</p>
        <p>
            <code>&lt;p&gt;dear reader&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!-- What follows is an inline comment in the same line--&gt;</code>
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>&lt;!-- After this inline comment, I’m currently writing a longer block comment. It spans more than one line of code and has a line break. In the case of HTML, it can be a bit confusing because there is no difference in the symbols used to signify whether it’s an inline or a block comment. --&gt;</code>
        </p>
        <p>This can be handled differently depending on the programming language. There is a lot of variation
            in the different symbol strings that mark a comment.<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-4-bf2b2f0b474854b2"
                class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-4-bf2b2f0b474854b2"><span class="footnote-link">[4]</span></sup> For the
            programming languages I’m familiar with they are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>HTML uses this <code>&lt;!-- comment --&gt;</code> for both inline and block comments.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>CSS uses this <code>/* comment */</code> also for both inline and block comments.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>JavaScript and PHP both use <code>//comment</code> for inline comments and <code>/* comment */</code>
                    for block comments.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p> <mark>This text has comments as well. Originally, this text was written in Obsidian, a
                note-taking software that uses <a data-tooltip-position="top"
                    aria-label="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" rel="noopener nofollow"
                    class="external-link" href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/"
                    target="_blank">Markdown</a> as its sort of programming language. The comments I am writing inside
                Obsidian are declared by typing <code>%%</code>. All the text that follows will be treated as a comment.
                To close it and return to the regular text, I must type <code>%%</code> again.</mark></p>
        <p>Either way, even though the way to mark a text as a comment differs for many programming
            languages, the functions stay the same. The one I want to focus on is communicating something that is
            intended for human readers.<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-5-bf2b2f0b474854b2" class="footnote-ref"
                id="fnref-5-bf2b2f0b474854b2"><span class="footnote-link">[5]</span></sup> As something that seems
            trivial but has been picked up repeatedly by different authors, the code has a certain duality to it.<sup

            machines. This raises the question of who we are writing code for: machine or human? It may seem like we are
            writing code for the machine to tell it what to do, but are we really? I like how Vikram Chandra puts Donald
            Knuth’s struggle with this question in Geek Sublime.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>If ever there was a person who fluently spoke the native idiom of machines, it is Knuth, computing’s
                great living sage. More than anyone else, he understands the paradox that programmers write code for
                other humans, not for machines: “Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of programs:
                Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do, let us concentrate rather
                on explaining to human beings what we want a computer to do.<sup

        </blockquote>
        <p>Knuth, a big proponent of writing code meant to be read and understood by humans, coined the term
            <em>literate programming</em> in his 1984 paper and later, in 1992, wrote a book about it. In his case, he
            advocated for code as a form of discourse between people—the coder as writer and essayist. For Knuth, code
            should be clear, legible, and communicate its function. Additionally, all the code should be documented in a
            way that explains how exactly the code works in an elaborate literary way.<sup

                    class="footnote-link">[9]</span></sup> He suggests writing code so that big parts of the code are
            only important to the human reader, not the performing machine. An excerpt from Ross Williams sums this up
            nicely on Daniel Mall’s website <a data-tooltip-position="top"

        <blockquote>
            <p>A traditional computer program consists of a text file containing program code. Scattered in amongst the
                program code are comments which describe the various parts of the code. In literate programming the
                emphasis is reversed. Instead of writing code containing documentation, the literate programmer writes
                documentation containing code.<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-10-bf2b2f0b474854b2" class="footnote-ref"

        </blockquote>
        <p>The focus is on the human. The comment is one way to achieve this programming paradigm, as it has
            a singular human audience. Knuth went down his own rabbit hole with this and created a whole system to
            program this way.<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-11-bf2b2f0b474854b2" class="footnote-ref"
                id="fnref-11-bf2b2f0b474854b2"><span class="footnote-link">[11]</span></sup> This also questions the
            important part of the code—for Knuth, it’s the comment or the documentation. Similarly, certain currents in
            literary studies, such as Critical Code Studies or Source Code Criticism, also question this topic. While
            Critical Code Studies focus more on the meaning and implications of code in terms of the social context<sup
                data-footnote-id="fnref-12-bf2b2f0b474854b2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-12-bf2b2f0b474854b2"><span
                    class="footnote-link">[12]</span></sup>, Source Code Criticism is more about developing and
            generating an understanding of code by enriching the code with knowledge about its origin, function and
            context.<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-13-bf2b2f0b474854b2" class="footnote-ref"
                id="fnref-13-bf2b2f0b474854b2"><span class="footnote-link">[13]</span></sup> Bajohr and Krajewski’s take
            on Source Code Criticism is that the comment is a central tool for documenting and explaining code for
            further study without interrupting the aspect of the machine performing the code.<sup
                data-footnote-id="fnref-14-bf2b2f0b474854b2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-14-bf2b2f0b474854b2"><span
                    class="footnote-link">[14]</span></sup> This way of thinking about the relation between code and
            comment really resonates with me. Going into this text, I had some of my own ideas about the relation
            between code and comment, and it’s always nice to realize there were others before me who also thought about
            this. <mark>I also get the same feeling when coding. There are always people out there who had the same
                problem and already solved it.</mark> Everything is so relational—Code or writing, it always happens on
            the back of others who came before me. Quoting other writing, copying code others have written, writing
            notes, and writing comments. While writing this text, there is a multitude of different annotations, like my
            personal notes, all the comments, and footnotes. I’m wondering what the important part is—my writing,
            personal anecdotes, or the original texts of others I refer to in the footnotes, with this text being a kind
            of fluff piece to contain them. What is the central or essential part of the writing, and what should be
            highlighted?</p>
        <p>Approaching this from the position of a graphic designer, there is also always a decision to be
            made about the importance of the running text and everything adjacent to it. What are the relations between
            the font sizes, how much space will I give footnotes on a page, will they be part of the margin or the
            running text, and how big will I make the margin? Thinking about the aesthetics of the very traditional ways
            of book setting from the Middle Ages or the more modern formalized constructions of the print area from the
            likes of Jan Tschichold, they seem to me like there is an emphasis on big margins.</p>
        <p>Apart from the arguments on aesthetics, there is plenty of space for notes. To me, these gestures
            emphasize commenting, taking notes, or writing your own thoughts in a book that has the physical space for
            it.<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-15-bf2b2f0b474854b2" class="footnote-ref"
                id="fnref-15-bf2b2f0b474854b2"><span class="footnote-link">[15]</span></sup> In short, there is a lot of
            space for marginalia—all the sorts of things that are happening in the margins of a book.<sup
                data-footnote-id="fnref-16-bf2b2f0b474854b2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-16-bf2b2f0b474854b2"><span
                    class="footnote-link">[16]</span></sup> I like that marginalia are a somewhat open space for what
            they can be. Everything that happens in the margins or outside of the print area is available for anyone—a
            sort of free commons on the book page. This feeling does not translate one-to-one for me when going from
            writing to coding—or a text editor to a coding environment. All of these thoughts of footnotes, quotes,
            annotations, and marginalia meld together into a comment—or more like they all exist in the space between
            the opening and closing string of a comment. Although I included marginalia into this space, that is, the
            comment out of all of the forms of different annotations, marginalia feels closest to comments in terms of
            openness—as comments, as well as marginalia, can be pretty open spaces in terms of what happens inside them.
            This also brings me to the title of this thesis <em>Code Marginalia</em>. For me, marginalia serves
            primarily as a lens through which to view comments, to figure out what they are, how to approach them, and
            how to connect them to other forms of annotation. This title and topic are also in relation to the ongoing
            research <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://kimkleinert.com/" rel="noopener nofollow"

        <p>To better understand where comments are coming from, I would like to take a closer look at the

            <h1 data-heading="A look into the past">A look into the past</h1>
        <p>A very close friend of mine currently works for the State Library of Berlin, where she is working
            for a project called <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://handschriftenportal.de/"
                rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://handschriftenportal.de/"
                target="_blank">Handschriftenportal</a>. It‘s a digital repository of European book manuscripts in
            German collections, providing a platform for researchers interested in knowledge preserved in medieval and
            early modern handwritten books. Since then, I‘ve got a lot of pictures of the weirdest (cute!) little
            illustrations that my friend has found over time—they are marginalia. A year ago, I would have never guessed
            that there would be a connection between my degree and the screenshots of marginalia from the Middle Ages on
            my phone. We have not talked about this weird coincidence yet, but I asked her if her more research-focused
            colleagues have some articles on marginalia they could recommend. They recommended a recent article by Zoe
            Screti <em>Finding the Marginal in Marginalia</em>, which advocates for the inclusion of recording
            descriptions of marginalia in catalog entries to empower relevant yet still marginalized voices in the
            margins.<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-17-bf2b2f0b474854b2" class="footnote-ref"
                id="fnref-17-bf2b2f0b474854b2"><span class="footnote-link">[17]</span></sup> Screti sums up marginalia's
            history and recent discourse before advocating for a shift in the current cataloging practice.<sup

                    class="footnote-link">[18]</span></sup></p>
        <p>Screti defines marginalia as follows:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Today, as then, marginalia is used to describe any form of markings (both visual and textual, printed and
                handwritten) made on a text that are usually—but not always—located in the margins of the said text.
                p124<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-19-bf2b2f0b474854b2" class="footnote-ref"

        </blockquote>
        <p>The word traces its history back to 1640, when it was used for the first time to refer to printed
            marginal notes that provided additional context to the main text. But the practice of writing in books is
            much older than the term—before marginalia, it was <em>apostille</em>—deriving from the Latin word
            <em>postilla</em> for note. Screti notes that marking a book is an active response to what a reader has
            read. In that way, marginalia leaves a trail of personal thoughts and reactions behind, a document of the
            dialog between the reader, the author, and the text. For researchers, they are an invaluable resource
            providing glimpses into the readers and their socio-cultural contexts.<sup
                data-footnote-id="fnref-20-bf2b2f0b474854b2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-20-bf2b2f0b474854b2"><span
                    class="footnote-link">[20]</span></sup> This approach of understanding the socio-cultural contexts
            through annotations can be traced to the digital with Source Code Criticism, as it employs comparable
            approaches. Bajohr and Krajewski trace the function of the modern comment through time back to commenting in
            the legal practice since late antiquity and the theological exegesis—the explanation and interpretation of a
            text, especially the Bible.<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-21-bf2b2f0b474854b2" class="footnote-ref"
                id="fnref-21-bf2b2f0b474854b2"><span class="footnote-link">[21]</span></sup> At least for exegesis, this
            happened—as far as I understood it, in the margins and was also transferred by scribes into later copies of
            the books. Coming from the digital, it‘s also interesting to read about the shift to the digital in the
            field of marginalia research. Screti discusses the digital representation of marginalia, mentioning the slow
            paradigm shift from using the term marginalia to <em>paratextual material</em>, which encompasses the full
            range of marginal notation. <mark>I‘m wondering if I should have called my thesis <em>code paratextual
                    materials</em>, this just rolls off the tongue.</mark> Screti also refers to Tatiana Nikolaeva
            Nikolova-Houston‘s classification of marginalia within hypertext theory and her comparison of the function
            of marginalia with hyperlinks on websites.<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-22-bf2b2f0b474854b2"
                class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-22-bf2b2f0b474854b2"><span class="footnote-link">[22]</span></sup> Even
            though Nikolova-Houston‘s view connects more to hyperlinks than comments, it‘s interesting that there is
            this overlap in marginalia and HTML. Helen J. Burgess, a media studies researcher, connects marginalia and
            printmaking to HTML and comments.<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-23-bf2b2f0b474854b2" class="footnote-ref"
                id="fnref-23-bf2b2f0b474854b2"><span class="footnote-link">[23]</span></sup> Burgess connects the pecia
            system, which was used in the process of hand copying medieval books<sup
                data-footnote-id="fnref-24-bf2b2f0b474854b2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-24-bf2b2f0b474854b2"><span
                    class="footnote-link">[24]</span></sup>—and the marks the process leaves as marginalia—to HTML
            marking sections of content and comments.</p>
        <p>For her, comments share formal similarities to pecia marks, as they are both marking sections and
            spaces for content. Same as Bajohr and Krajewski, Burges draws a parallel between comments and exegesis. For
            her, these aspects of explanation and interpretation are the key differences to pecia marks. Comments as
            literary devices seek to explain what will happen when code is performed—they are a companion to code and a
            tool for communication with other people.<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-25-bf2b2f0b474854b2"
                class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-25-bf2b2f0b474854b2"><span class="footnote-link">[25]</span></sup> In
            this sense, she aligns with the values of <span class="internal-link">Literate Programming</span>. All these
            perspectives reaffirm to me a deep connection between comments and marginalia. On the one hand, both have
            similar functions in the field of annotations—especially if one considers commentaries as paratextual
            material, where I understand the textual as code. On the other hand, through the connection between
            comments, in this case as a form of literary criticism - not code comments, as seen in exegesis and law,
            marginalia, in which most of them take place,<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-26-bf2b2f0b474854b2"
                class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-26-bf2b2f0b474854b2"><span class="footnote-link">[26]</span></sup> and
            the modern comment - the one in code - which can trace its history back to literary comment. When I look at
            the relation between <a data-tooltip-position="top"
                aria-label="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/466179" rel="noopener nofollow"

                class="internal-link">Literate Programming</span> vibes.</p>
        <p>Going back to Bajohr and Krajewski and their short summary of the history of the comment, they
            also shine a light on comments in editorial philology<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-27-bf2b2f0b474854b2"
                class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-27-bf2b2f0b474854b2"><span class="footnote-link">[27]</span></sup> to
            review the comment as a tool for reflection through the lens of Source Code Criticism. They emphasize the
            cognitive gap between text and comment and the automatic change of perspective one can get from crossing
            this gap. This continuous change of perspective creates a distance to the subject matter and serves as a
            means of self-reflection and critical examination of the writing process.<sup
                data-footnote-id="fnref-28-bf2b2f0b474854b2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-28-bf2b2f0b474854b2"><span
                    class="footnote-link">[28]</span></sup> I think this mechanism also applies outside of Source Code
            Criticism. I often feel like this while writing comments to myself while coding or, in this case, writing.
            When coding, I tend to write what I want the function to do as a comment before and iterate between code and
            text while coding and adding or editing comments and notes. Sometimes, I also write paper notes because I
            feel that the motion of handwriting helps me more than typing the same thought—or it won‘t come out unless
            I‘m writing by hand.</p>
        <p><mark>When I look around both physically and digitally, I‘m surrounded by comments and notes.
                Currently, I’m writing at a desk in my living room—it‘s close to 8pm. I’m nearly done for today, and I
                am fried. On my left is a jumble of notes—random thoughts on paper while I’m not at my computer; a
                Kaufland receipt with notes from one of my flatmates, who took the time to listen to me while I had my
                first (hopefully last) meltdown about this thesis and later helped me with structuring; a few mind maps
                trying to conjure a semblance of a common thread through my thoughts into this text; lastly tow Kimchi
                recipes. In my writing environment, a few sources are currently open as tabs, and my random thoughts
                about the process of writing this text, how the website and the print version will look, are going
                either into this text itself, my documents called thoughts and design &amp; writing.</mark> </p>

        <p>Mixing and matching whatever medium to record a thought or leave a note feels close to how I
            perceive the transition from handwritten comments for code to digital comments in code. I was vaguely aware
            of punch cards, but with how coding works now, the early era of computing feels so far away. The first
            general-purpose electronic computer was the ENIAC. The purpose and associated development of this computer
            were ballistic calculations for the US military - it was therefore used to calculate the trajectories of
            artillery and missiles so that they would not miss their targets. Like many technical inventions that we
            rely on today, the computer too began as a project of the military-industrial complex.</p>
        <p>The ENIAC was operated with knobs, plugboards, and an external memory with punch cards. The
            program had to be written on a piece of paper and then translated into binary for the machine to understand
            and input into the different parts of the computer by turning the right knobs, plugging cables into the
            plugboards, and ingesting punch cards.<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-29-bf2b2f0b474854b2" class="footnote-ref"

            complicated steps for operating this computer were performed by women—called the ENIAC Girls, who were
            forgotten in history for a long time. They were mostly regarded as nothing more than operators—clerks akin
            to switchboard operators—by their male colleagues.<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-30-bf2b2f0b474854b2"

                think it‘s good to already have this information in the main text—even though I will have a deeper dive
                into this topic in the following chapter.</mark></p>
        <p>In this era of handwritten or typewritten code, I wonder how many notes and comments were written
            down on paper—part code, part notes, and scribbles. I imagine little reminders and drawings for remembering
            the specific quirks of this machine, notes to self, and notes to others. Scribbles, crossed-out errors, or
            rewritten letters and numbers because they were not readable enough. Notes to help with figuring out how a
            specific program should work and notes for the conversion to binary. Notes and markings on specific punch
            cards and maybe even comments on the final versions of binary instructions.<sup

                    class="footnote-link">[31]</span></sup> All of this happens in the margins of the instructions fed
            to ENIAC to perform code. I think that was a time when comments could be considered marginalia in the
            classical sense.<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-32-bf2b2f0b474854b2" class="footnote-ref"

        <p>Coding was very tedious and challenging in this era of computing. Over the coming decades, new
            approaches and ways of programming were found step by step, which also transformed the form of comment. With

        <p><mark>It was so hard to grasp how early computing with knobs, switchboards, and punchcards worked.
                In the beginning, I had no idea how code would be transferred to something like a punchcard or tape
                because all the literature I read assumed knowledge about this process. So, I turned to Science YouTube
                for help and was rewarded. I’m such a sucker for good science communication. After binging a lot of
                different YouTube videos and taking notes, I’m glad I finally have a rough overview of the history of
                computing - even if it’s just through the lens of comments. At the beginning of my research, I focused
                more on the social aspect of coding. Still, I realized that I really have to get to know the basics of
                the technical aspect of these early computing technologies to understand how this transition from paper
                to digital came and how comments transitioned in this period.</mark></p>
        <p>I present to you a brief summary of the history of computers from the perspective of the comments.
            Throughout researching this transition period<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-35-bf2b2f0b474854b2"
                class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-35-bf2b2f0b474854b2"><span class="footnote-link">[35]</span></sup> and
            getting to know all these different technologies, I’ve noticed that even though the hardware changes over
            time, the programming languages and their features are always the ones that are supported on the devices.
            So, the focus through all these iterations of computers and storage media lies on the language of code and
            the human element, not necessarily the device. Nevertheless, the devices are still important in
            understanding this transformation process, as these devices determine the medium on which writing takes
            place—initially analog and later digital. In the 1950s—the era of ENIAC and its successor devices—computers
            used different media for storing and loading programs or code. These were knobs and switches, plugboards
            with cables, paper tape as well as punch cards. The basic workflow from coder to computer was the following:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Write down your basic idea of what the code should do by hand.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Next, you write the actual code on a coding form. A piece of paper that is comparable to a code
                    editor today. The code would have been in Assembly or, later, a high-level programming language. If
                    you write code for the ENIAC, you will have to translate the code into Machine Language by hand.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Next, you transfer your code to a memory medium the computer accepts. These could have been a series
                    of knobs, where you have to switch them on and represent the binary code. Another way would have
                    been a plugboard, where you connect outputs to each other with cables. The third way was punch cards
                    or paper tape. With them, you could type your code into a dedicated machine that would punch the
                    paper holes accordingly. In the case of the punch card, one card represents one line of code.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Run the program.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>This process did not change much between the different programming languages. While writing code,
            there was always space for comments, notes, or scribbles on the paper—it did not depend on the language, and
            all code was prewritten on coding forms. The early high-level languages like FORTRAN<sup

            the option to also write comments directly in the code by marking the line with the right symbol. These
            could also be encoded onto the punch cards, with the additional option of commenting out any line of code
            afterward by punching out a certain field on the card. The whole punch card would be treated as a
            comment—irrelevant to the machine but still an integral part of the order of the punch card stack. In a way,
            the comment could be transferred from the margins of the coding form to a new state. It would be embedded in
            the code's main text but still retain its status as an outsider, as it would not be seen as relevant for
            part of the code's readership - the machine.<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-38-bf2b2f0b474854b2"

            comment directly in the terminal on the computer itself. With these new computers and their operating

        <p>However, this digression into the history of the comment and, hence, also into the history of
            programming has largely ignored a crucial aspect. The consideration of the social aspect and the social
            practices that have developed over the decades—a history of what I perceived as bad vibes. And also a
            history linked to why the comment is so important to me. One of my main sources for understanding the social
            aspects of the last 80 years of computing history is Nathan Ensmenger’s book <em>The Computer Boys Take
                Over</em>, in which he examines the rise of the computer expert in American Society over the last
            century. However, the questionable history of technology as a male narrative goes back much further.<sup

        <p>Going back to the setting of the 1940s, when computing was getting started, women were mostly
            relegated to clerical positions like human data processing or execution, with men being in charge of the
            research and development of this new technology. It wasn’t any different with the ENIAC. The women who
            worked on this project set up the machines and should simply implement the instructions of the male
            planners. They were at the bottom of the hierarchy of intellectual and professional status. Yet the process
            of translating the instructions into machine code and inputting them into the machine turned out to be not a
            simple operation. It required innovative thinking and new approaches developed by the female coders. What
            was thought to be a straightforward process of coding an algorithm turned out to be a multi-layered process
            of analysis, planning, testing, and troubleshooting. They had to fight for the acknowledgment of their
            insights and improvements in computing. The so-called <em>ENIAC Girls</em> were unknown and not recognized
            for their contributions for a long time.<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-46-bf2b2f0b474854b2"
                class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-46-bf2b2f0b474854b2"><span class="footnote-link">[46]</span></sup> These
            and later many other women in similar positions were a crucial part of this part of computing history, with
            many becoming programmers. This left the programming field in a somewhat uncertain position regarding the
            social status connected to the works. Both men, who came from high-status research jobs, and women from
            low-status clerical positions became programmers. At the same time, the field began the professionalization
            process to become a high-status discipline. Until the 50s and 60s, the programming profession was still
            relatively open to women compared to other occupations in the same period, but the advancing
            professionalization changed this.<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-47-bf2b2f0b474854b2" class="footnote-ref"
                id="fnref-47-bf2b2f0b474854b2"><span class="footnote-link">[47]</span></sup> This professionalization is
            a central aspect of the masculinization of programming. Ensmenger refers to Margaret Rossiter and others who
            have suggested that the process of professionalization is deeply rooted in the exclusion of women.</p>
        <p>To improve the status of the disciple, the often feminized aspects of low-status work had to be
            excluded from the profession. In addition, a prerequisite level of higher education makes access to the
            profession more difficult. This made it disproportionally hard for women to enter the profession—especially
            when also encumbered by the role of mother and or wife.<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-48-bf2b2f0b474854b2"

            Professionalism also implies a level of authority and expertise—qualities that haven’t been associated with
            femininity.<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-49-bf2b2f0b474854b2" class="footnote-ref"

            pressure for increasing professionalization to the following key reasons. The software industry of the 1960s
            was in great need of programmers as the computerization of business was rapidly expanding. With a shortage
            of programmers, they started to become highly sought-after workers with an increased status in their
            jobs.<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-50-bf2b2f0b474854b2" class="footnote-ref"
                id="fnref-50-bf2b2f0b474854b2"><span class="footnote-link">[50]</span></sup> This, however, collided
            with the managerial class of workers, as they felt threatened in their positions. In the eyes of managers
            and office workers, unruly and unpredictable programmers had to struggle to find their place in the company
            hierarchy.<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-51-bf2b2f0b474854b2" class="footnote-ref"
                id="fnref-51-bf2b2f0b474854b2"><span class="footnote-link">[51]</span></sup> The way I read it,
            professionalizing programming was a way of standardizing this new group of workers. To make them more
            predictable and cost-efficient and to integrate them fully into the established system without endangering
            the existing corporate structures.</p>
        <p>One way companies tried to select the people for the job of programmer was by testing programs for
            new employees. These programs often included pseudoscientific aptitude tests and personality profiles. They
            included a focus on mathematic skills or a formal education in mathematics, which was even disproven when
            these tests first appeared and favored antisocial men with an interest in mathematics—the detached male
            programmer.<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-52-bf2b2f0b474854b2" class="footnote-ref"
                id="fnref-52-bf2b2f0b474854b2"><span class="footnote-link">[52]</span></sup> The goal of those testing
            programs for companies was to transition from dependence on the few highly skilled programmers to a larger,
            less skilled workforce, where each programmer is interchangeable.<sup

                    class="footnote-link">[53]</span></sup> With this systematic preselection for a particular type of
            man to be a programmer, the stereotype of the antisocial, male, mathematics-inclined programmer came to be
            in the 1960s and was embraced by men as a self-ascription of the profession.<sup

            patterns took root, whose impact I can still feel today. The idea of real programmers who work on real
            computers with genuine programming languages. They understand the computer and think in machine code. They
            don’t need easy programming languages because they are just that good with code. No one else can probably
            understand their code because it’s just too clever and exploits the hardware on a fundamental level.<sup

                programming, which I see as a foundational element of the toxic climate in programming culture, a

        <p>All of this builds a narrative about who can code and who should have access to it. Returning to
            the first comment in this text, where I talked about my struggle to decide on a language to write this text
            in, the language of code is another substantial factor in the imperialistic—and to a certain degree
            colonizing—aspects engrained into coding. There is no real alternative to the English language.</p>
        <p>Until I got into coding, I was still pretty naive about this, if I’m honest. I remember one of my
            first thoughts about this was: <em>How do people who don’t speak English or use a keyboard with a Latin
                alphabet actually code? Yeah, you will probably just use your specific character set, and it will work
                somehow.</em> This idea of universal language and character support was shattered as I realized how
            people in our class would switch their keyboard from their native layout, like Hangul, to English. I
            realized quickly that there is basically only English in the commercialized world of coding. There are, in
            comparison to the totality of all programming languages, a few that are non-English. Still, many of them are
            either not really compatible, proof of concepts, or for educational purposes.<sup

            qwerty layout. Plenty of people I know switched permanently to the English layout because of coding.</p>
        <p>As Marino puts it, the choice to base programming languages on one specific natural language has
            significant implications for everyone interacting with it. It can have colonizing effects on non-native
            speakers, and every programmer who is not a native speaker is at a disadvantage in the computational
            economy, as they don’t have the same connection to the different tokes or syntax adopted from the natural
            language.<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-65-bf2b2f0b474854b2" class="footnote-ref"

        <p>But what about the comment? On the web, you can see the source code of a website quite easily
            compared to other software, like the browser itself. The inspector in modern browsers and the view source
            function display a website’s HTML code and provide access to the CSS and JavaScript files a website uses.
            With this, I can look through the web code and all the comments left behind. With so much of the code behind
            software hidden or inaccessible, I wondered why every modern browser would happily show me everything it
            could. This can be traced back to the early 1990s and early browser development when developers realized
            that this could be a fun feature to let people see the website’s code as it was sent to the browser either
            way to render the website. With view source, every website became an opportunity to experiment and learn
            from—web code became accessible and easily sharable.<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-76-bf2b2f0b474854b2"

            Inspector for Safari unified all of the different aspects in 2006 into tools that worked inside the browser.
            Firebug focused more on debugging JavaScript, while Web Inspector, on the other hand, prioritized viewing

            many websites focussing on user-generated content and the websites growing ever more complex. For a big part
            of the web, you can still peak at what is happening, but you don’t get the full picture anymore. As Burgess
            explains with php. The browser still displays the HTML as the end result, but nobody can see the code for
            everything that happens on the server, like fetching specific data from a database to build the HTML.<sup
                data-footnote-id="fnref-79-bf2b2f0b474854b2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-79-bf2b2f0b474854b2"><span
                    class="footnote-link">[79]</span></sup> With ever more users on websites like Facebook, Twitter, or
            Youtube, a growing tech stack to manage and optimize these platforms, and progressing monetization, these
            websites transform into closed-down applications running on the web. This is also the time of a paradigm
            shift for the web at large. It moves away from an ethos of sharing code to build your own web to one of
            proprietary code only seen because of the technological remnants of early web history. For me, the rise of
            JavaScript frameworks like React or Vue since the 2010s<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-80-bf2b2f0b474854b2"
                class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-80-bf2b2f0b474854b2"><span class="footnote-link">[80]</span></sup>, as
            well as the increase of template builder websites<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-81-bf2b2f0b474854b2"
                class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-81-bf2b2f0b474854b2"><span class="footnote-link">[81]</span></sup>, are
            symptomatic of this shift, as they streamline the process of making websites and web apps but sacrifice the
            accessibility and understandability of the code while visiting the website.</p>
        <p><mark>I want to elaborate more on my position on frameworks, especially template builders. With
                frameworks targeted at web developers, I think it’s great that there are tools that make web development
                easier or, in many cases, web app development. At the same time, I’m thinking about the reasons for
                streamlining these processes, and I believe that, in many cases, it can be summarized as optimizing
                because of market pressure. If the trade is sacrificing the understandability and accessibility of code
                and, by proxy, reducing the potential agency of people interacting with a given website for economic
                benefit, I really think it’s a bad trade. A trade all of us have to make, but nevertheless, a trade we
                are somewhat forced to make due to our economic circumstances or market pressure in general.</mark></p>
        <p><mark>Website template builders, which are used by regular people, designers, and developers, are
                good things by themselves. The ability of tools to assist people who are not able to code when making
                websites is wonderful. I think that creating websites and web-based art is not inherently connected to
                the ability to code, and websites or web-based art is not in any way worse than if it had been coded. At
                the same time, I think the ability to code opens other avenues to understand the medium of websites,
                which may be specific to code and are worth exploring. My main issue with the current system and
                specifically the business model of template builders is the shift from tool to closed ecosystem service.
                If I can use a website builder as a tool, that‘s great! If it locks me into a system with limited
                options and a monthly subscription fee, where I cannot leave without losing my website—not great. On top
                of that, the generated HTML code has the same issue as the code generated by frameworks, as the
                potential agency is turned into higher profit margins.</mark></p>
        <p><mark>Edit: I could not find a good spot to discuss code minification, so it’s also here.</mark>
        </p>
        <p><mark>Similar to frameworks, code minification is also a way to optimize web code. It compresses
                the code by removing all <em>unnecessary</em> characters. This loads the JavaScript faster but makes the
                code unreadable unless it is somehow reworked. Even in that case, all original variable names, comments,
                etc., are wholly lost. When thinking about optimization in this case, I wonder for whom something is
                optimized? Certainly not you and me.</mark></p>
        <p>For me, apps of websites on the phone and mobile browsers represent the endpoint of this
            obfuscation process. Apps transform the original websites into fully closed pieces of software, removing
            them entirely from any ethos of interacting with the code, while mobile browsers take away all options for
            viewing source code and interacting with code in general. Reading about trend forecasts predicting that the
            majority of people connecting to the Internet already experience it exclusively via their mobile devices<sup

                    class="footnote-link">[82]</span></sup>, I really wonder if the idea of making a website something
            that is not mediated through a service is already a thing of the past which only a few lost souls, i.e., web
            designers cling on—so me and maybe you.</p>
        <p>This leaves me in a somewhat awkward spot.<br>
            For whom am I making websites, and why?<br>
            Am I a service as well?</p>
        <p>I know why I make websites—it’s fun, and I really enjoy every aspect of making them. The whole
            process is very personal, which is important to acknowledge. Most personal or professional websites I have
            made have been designed and programmed by me alone. The few times I collaborated with others, the process
            was either split between design and programming, or it was close to two people designing and coding on one
            device. I like to work on things where the project scope stays somewhat small and, to a certain degree,
            personal. I like collaborating with others, but I don’t enjoy being part of a bigger system where I can only
            do specific tasks regarding design or programming. I want to have a bond with the things I make and spend so
            much time with.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>For me, this applies to both personal and professional projects. When being compensated for making
            a website, I’d rather like the website to be a record of a collaboration, a bond, than a service I provide.
            I want to move away from the notion of the clean, effortless final product that appears out of thin air to
            be consumed. I want my websites to be imbued with their history—to be both a completed object and the
            process itself. I realized that this dual nature is why I like the medium of the website so much. Be it on
            the Internet or even as a local HTML file. <mark>This is the first time I’ve experienced this with a medium.
                As I did a lot of 3D and regular graphic design before making websites, I was always surrounded by
                digital files. But so much was unseen, with a disconnect between the final object and the process of
                making it. Having 100 GB of files as the process was reduced to a single JPEG object somehow always felt
                weird.</mark> For me, this duality of object and process translates to the split between the website
            that exists due to the code being performed and the code that is performed for the website to exist.
            Switching between these two very different layers and experiences opens up somewhat of a place for me. I can
            experience the same thing in two different Modi, with potentially very different types of material, without
            them interfering negatively. If I’m interested in taking a peek behind the curtain, I’m allowed to—I love
            that curiosity is rewarded.</p>
        <p>I want to set up a place for people who engage with the things I make.<br>
            I want to set up a place for people who are interested in websites.<br>
            I want to set up a place for people who are curious.<br>
            I want to set up a place where my past self would have felt welcome.<br>
            I want to set up a place where I treat you, me, and web code with <em>care</em>.<br>
            There are places like this on the Internet, and I want to contribute to them.</p>













        <h1 data-heading="How do you fit into all of this, dear comment?">How do you fit into all of this,
            dear comment?</h1>
        <p>The comment, I think, is one way that helps set up places like these. It is a tool for
            communication, and I want to embrace this. Be it to write to myself, collaborators, or others who see the
            website. From what I experienced while browsing and writing comments, they can take many different shapes.
            I‘ll try to organize my impressions into a few aspects to better describe what I see in these different
            types of comments. However, I don‘t understand them as selective categories; rather, they are overlapping
            fields where a comment can have one or multiple aspects.</p>
        <p>The first and most common type is the aspect of explanation. This type of comment is all about
            describing the code's functionality in a short, clear, and impersonal manner. From my experience, this is
            also what is used most by the coding community and is generally understood as a comment. When scrolling
            through Reddit and other forums, as well as skimming over good practice advice, this is what I see most
            often as the canonized comment, with many debates over what a good or a bad comment is. I imagine scenarios
            where code is commented on in preparation for a hand-off between developers or while trying to organize the
            contributions of many people more efficiently. I somewhat see Knuth‘s ideal of literate programming in this
            aspect, as it also focuses on explaining code. To a certain degree, it’s good practice to describe your code
            with comments. However, it’s something that programmers seem to do afterward and to a lesser degree than
            they would like to in theory.<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-83-bf2b2f0b474854b2" class="footnote-ref"
                id="fnref-83-bf2b2f0b474854b2"><span class="footnote-link">[83]</span></sup> This also explains to me
            why the more elaborate and work-intensive ways of commenting, like literate programming, never caught on.
            The way current large language models<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-84-bf2b2f0b474854b2" class="footnote-ref"
                id="fnref-84-bf2b2f0b474854b2"><span class="footnote-link">[84]</span></sup> comment code also falls for
            me in this aspect, as they can only reproduce the status quo. Acknowledging this status quo, I think it‘s
            good that it is now possible to make written code more understandable by including automatically generated
            documentation. Looking back at the history of code and computing, this way of engaging with the comment and
            code in general stays in the confines of the masculine-coded programming tradition. Even with an outlier
            like literate programming, this aspect has an underlying motive of efficiency and rationality. Code has to
            be commented on to streamline the working processes. I see this aspect in a continuous struggle to find a
            balance between writing and not writing comments to maximize efficiency and, by proxy, profit. Further
            automating this time-consuming process of commenting in a standardized way using large language models seems
            to solve this struggle in the near future.</p>
        <p>Initially, I still had a way of thinking about comments and code that tended to label them as good
            and bad to a certain extent. The more I looked into the topic, the more I realized that the debate and
            evaluation between good and bad is not particularly helpful. It‘s so shaped by historically grown values
            that classification is not practical for me, as nearly everything that is important to me in comments exists
            in opposition to efficiency, productivity, and impersonality.</p>
        <p>Re-examining the aspect of explanation outside the bounds of efficiency, the key function of
            explaining code stays the same, but the goal can change. A website can become a repository of knowledge and
            a learning tool for others that is more accessible and understandable than just code. In that way, I
            resonate with Knuth’s idea of literate programming, but more in the sense of taking the time to think and
            reflect about how to communicate what code does in a way that prioritizes the human reading it. I also see
            the opportunity for citation or referring to others to build a network of references and relations to other
            people and websites, embedding it into a contemporary period of web-making.</p>
        <p>For me, the aspect of the archive represents the contextualization of present and unused code, as
            well as existing, unutilized, or even rejected features. So, writing about everything that is present,
            commented out, or not in the code anymore. Reflecting on decisions, recoding processes, documenting features
            that never came to be, mourning parts that no longer exist, treasuring drafts, and imagining alternative
            paths. I think of this aspect as a personal interpretation of version control on the website itself.</p>
        <p>Moving beyond code itself, I want to talk more about the more personal aspects of commenting—the
            aspects of relation and intimacy. The aspect of relation represents comments that establish connections
            between me and something or someone else and position my work in larger or specific contexts that are
            important to me. I see them as ways to express inspiration, write about references, refer to ideas,
            recommend something, or share a fascination. The aspect of intimacy is all about emotions, thoughts, and
            opinions. Reminiscing about moments of joy, voicing struggles, hardships, and frustrations, telling an
            in-joke or sharing a secret, holding on to fleeting thoughts, and sharing some gossip. They are the records
            of day-to-day life while working on a website, little artifacts of moods—a sort of diary.</p>
        <p>The aspect of worldbuilding represents narrative elements and storytelling. I consider this
            aspect, to a certain extent, as an inversion of the aspect of intimacy, as it builds a fictional character
            that takes the place of the person making the website. Depictions of this could be websites as entities or
            characters serving as the main focal point of personal interaction and relation. I imagine narratives
            unfolding as a website grows older, gets updated, or certain milestones are achieved. Mixing storytelling
            and role play with the making, maintaining, and updating a website.</p>
        <p>Last, I want to talk about the aspect of ornamentation, which embodies the urge to decorate and
            organize. Even though it is not a comment, I would include the general shape of the web code in this aspect.
            For example, the stylistic choices made for indenting, line width, breaks or white space, and layout in
            general. This can also include considerations about the web code's general structure. Are different parts of
            code treated like chapters, or are certain parts of the CSS and JavaScript split between multiple files for
            specific purposes? Returning to the comment itself, I see it as a blank canvas for custom lettering,
            headlines, spacers, separation lines, illustrations, and many more forms of ASCII art—playing with the
            textual nature of code and subverting it. I see the aspect of ornamentation as an extension of the website’s
            design permeating through all layers of the website, as well as a graphical layer that can be used to deepen
            other aspects.</p>
        <p>All of these aspects exist outside the scope of writing functional code for a website to be
            performed. They are bridges enabling connections to other practices, which are able to enrich the experience
            of creating web code and interacting with environments of web code. I see comments as ways to relate to and
            reflect on the code I write. With my now better understanding of the history of code, I also feel the
            responsibility to critically engage with this part of my craft in an ongoing way—and why not visibly in the
            documents and websites I create. For me, a part of this is making my code understandable and relatable to
            non-programmers as well. In this, I align with many aspects of Bajohr and Krajewski‘s concept of Source code
            Criticism from the perspective of a person who writes code. Code in itself should be something that should
            be primarily written with human readers in mind. In source code criticism, the focus is more on analyzing
            algorithms and more complex code than on the websites I make. Nevertheless, I think that the approach of
            contextualizing web code as it is created and placing our actions in a larger context also makes sense for
            websites. On the one hand, with a view to all the people who visit the website in the present; on the other
            hand, with a view to the future and the possibility that the website could still be available in some form
            in archives or databases many years from now. When I search on the WaybackMachine myself, I wish I could
            find something additional on many websites that would tell me more about the context and the moment in which
            the website exists or about the people who made it. In the research for this thesis, I could only learn more
            about the background by reading interviews or memoirs; I wish this had also been possible on the websites
            themselves.</p>
        <p>Recently, I started watching Cory Archangel‘s <a data-tooltip-position="top"
                aria-label="https://rhizome.org/editorial/artbase-anthologies-002/" rel="noopener nofollow"
                class="external-link" href="https://rhizome.org/editorial/artbase-anthologies-002/"
                target="_blank">Let’s Play Majerus G3</a>. It‘s part artwork and research into the late painter Michel
            Majerus‘ restored laptop. Majerus used his computer in nearly all aspects of his working process as it was
            an extension of his studio into the digital. Archangel shares insights about Majerus‘s practice by exploring
            this digital working environment and explores how artists‘ use of digital tools could have shaped their
            work. Following this deep dive into Majerus‘ works left me wondering about artists or designers working
            exclusively with digital media or net art websites. Relating my own practice to this, I‘m wondering how much
            my laptop would say and how much is already inside the website—as I see it as a working environment
            supported by my code editor of choice. Using the analogy of the studio to reflect on the dual nature of
            object and process in websites. Here, the website as the object would be the artwork, and the website as the
            process would be the studio. In this sense, it feels weird to me that I am artificially cleaning my studio
            afterward or trying to use my studio space without leaving any traces behind. I see it as a somewhat magical
            property of websites that I can leave my whole studio within them. I‘m also realizing now why I think of
            websites in terms of spaces or a place. Using the metaphor of studio, I now start to understand why it‘s
            also so important to me to make these spaces nice and warm, as they are places I inhabit or inhabited.
            Looking at my physical desk right now, I‘m in front of my laptop, surrounded by my notes, different pens,
            snacks, tea, and plants, while my diffusor spreads bergamot fragrance. Of course, this also carries over
            into my digital working environments.</p>
        <p><mark>This last paragraph started as a comment, but I think it works better in the main text, even
                if it’s a bit scatterbrained? But just now, I was thinking about male living spaces and how they are
                often somewhat sad or awful places to exist in. Scrolling through <a data-tooltip-position="top"
                    aria-label="https://www.reddit.com/r/malelivingspace/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link"
                    href="https://www.reddit.com/r/malelivingspace/" target="_blank">r/malelivingspace</a> is a very
                sobering experience for me, with only a few outliers. When looking at these sad, for me, very
                cis-male-coded living spaces, I kind of get the same vibes as when looking at desolate web code.</mark>
        </p>
        <p>But building these personal spaces and sharing them with others somehow exudes an aura of
            unprofessionalism. I associate this link between personal web space and this perceived lack of
            professionalism with the commercialization of the web in the 2000s and the entry into the era of Web 2.0.
            The personal, quirky, the undesigned, and the hobbyist had to go<sup
                data-footnote-id="fnref-85-bf2b2f0b474854b2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-85-bf2b2f0b474854b2"><span
                    class="footnote-link">[85]</span></sup> and make way for a cleaner and better-designed look. For me,
            this professionalism expresses itself in terms of writing web code in code that is clean, efficient, and
            detached from the person writing it, as it is soaked in the conventions that established themselves
            throughout the history of coding. There is no room for the playful, the expressive, the opinionated, the
            relational, the personal. I see it as a way to erase the people working on web code, as well as their
            spaces. It hides the diverse voices, perspectives, and histories behind a veil of professionalism, further
            upholding the problematic web-making values.</p>
        <p>I think it‘s important to rethink what professionalism means and how this social code shapes what
            we do. It‘s not that I want to go back to yellow Comic Sans on a light green background, but I think it‘s
            important to reconsider where the web came from, where it will go, and what influence we have. The current
            values of professionalism regarding web code and the histories of code and web are deeply entangled in
            capitalist and patriarchal structures. As a result, I see how we tend to make the web as fundamentally in
            conflict with the effort and care it takes to set up these places through comments. In this sense,
            commenting could also be understood as a form of care within the framework of technofeminist theory.
            Commenting as a form of work within programming that is geared towards enabling access and participation for
            others—to care for those visiting and to make those who make the web more visible. I see them as an
            opportunity to reflect on and change how and for whom we write web code. More than just displaying the code
            of a website through view source, comments can make this part of a website into a more inviting
            space—working against the prejudice of who should have access to these spaces. Similar to feminist
            hackerspaces, I see the opportunity for websites to be places of learning, questioning, and sharing what it
            means to engage with the technologies we use.<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-86-bf2b2f0b474854b2"

            but as one of many possibilities to critically engage with the historically grown structures of our practice
            as web makers.</p>
        <p>So we need you, dear comment, to carry them—as web code is not yet able to carry these criticisms
            within itself.</p>
        <p>We need you to go to the margins.<br>
            We need you to step outside while staying in.<br>
            To distance ourselves and change our perspective.<br>
            Not because we are pushed aside—but to embrace an outsider’s position.</p>
        <p>We need you to set up spaces from within in which we can exist, act, and push for change.<br>
            Spaces that we want to inhabit. In which we also can learn, share, voice our struggles, or have fun.<br>
            To gather in them and connect with others—as so many have before us through time.</p>

                    <p>Of course, there are many potential uses of a comment besides communication. One that comes to
                        mind is commenting out code. If the goal is to have a piece of code not perform while still
                        keeping it, the code can be put in a comment. In a way, this code is stored in a state of limbo,
                        hidden from the machine, but maybe also not that relevant to the human reader. </p>

                    <p>The pecia system was a system for efficiently reproducing handwritten in the Middle Ages. Copy
                        texts, so-called exemplars, were loaned out in parts—in piecemeal or Latin pecia, to be copied
                        and then returned. This preserved the quality of the copied books by limiting errors. With this
                        system, multiple workshops worked on one copy of a book, which meant there was a need for
