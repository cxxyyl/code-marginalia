                        I’m thinking about which language to use to write this whole thing. My literature is mixed,
                        and my notes are all over the place. I’m asking friends for opinions on this. I think my English is
                        okay, but I could probably express myself better in German. But my gut is telling me, <em>Oh, it’s web/code
                        related, so I guess English it is.</em> Let’s hold this thought; it will reappear later.

                    As always, it all comes back to childhood fears, but let’s start with the present. In a way, all
                    of this feels quite Freudian. With me joining Klasse Digitale Grafik, I honestly did not think I’d end up
                    coding. I originally joined because of my interest in graphic design and my general interest in topics
                    related to the Internet. I knew coding was a part of this class, but I never thought I would develop such an
                    interest in the subject of code—primarily because my emotional connection to code used to be one of fear.
                    Over the last few years, I gradually managed to overcome this deeply rooted fear of coding. The more I
                    overcame it, the more fun I started to have while coding my small little websites. With this, which feels
                    like a generic progression for a person learning a new skill, I became more interested in how other websites
                    were made. With this, my descent into the rabbit hole of web programming started to accelerate, and I think
                    I crossed a point of no return with coding.

                        I’ve been thinking a lot about the tone of this thesis. Thinking back to the last thesis I
                        wrote, it had to have this scientific, neutral tone. In my previous thesis, I had to adopt a tone that
                        was objective, devoid of personal emotions, and focused on presenting facts and analysis. With the HFBK
                        and the freedom it offers to write my thesis, I’m pretty happy, as I want this to be more personal than
                        I had the chance to do before.

                    One of my first <em>PC memories</em> is sitting in front of the family PC running Windows 98, doodling in
                    Paint. I don’t have any recollection of surfing the web at this age. This changed when I got my first Laptop
                    in 2002—I was 10 or 11 years old at that point. <span class="comment-link c3"></span> With this, I also got
                    my own connection to the Internet at some point, probably by still plugging a cable from the router into the
                    LAN port of my Laptop. With a personal device and a connection to the Internet, I was well on my way to
                    becoming a very online teen. With the spread of social media and microblogging in the mid-2000s, I had a
                    cringy MySpace page and was later very active on Tumblr. Both sites allow you to customize your page or
                    blog. <sup class="footnote-link">1</sup> I really enjoyed all the
                    creativity people had with styling and personalizing their little web spaces, yet I never did that because I
                    was terrified of coding. With MySpace, I’m not so sure how I customized it anymore, but like Tumblr, it also
                    had a <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/myspace-and-the-coding-legacy/" target="_blank">code
                    editor.</a> With Tumblr, however, I vividly remember this moment of opening the custom CSS panel many
                    times and closing it again and again in fear. Ultimately, I always used themes—not that this is bad or worse
                    in any way than doing it yourself. However, it had somewhat of a sour aftertaste for me because I always
                    wanted to make my own stuff but could not out of fear and feelings of inadequacy. While researching this
                    thesis and thinking about my relation to code, many memories from my childhood and early teens came back. I
                    remembered why I used to be so afraid of coding—it was the <em>Informationstechnischer Grundkurs</em> I had
                    in 2005, which was seventh grade. <span class="comment-link c4"></span>

                        These are moments where I’m glad I kept all my old school reports. It seems like I finished
                        the course with a grade of 2 (B), which surprised me because I managed to partake in it and get a good
                        grade. Moments like these remind me that my memories are nothing more than canonized fanfiction of
                        myself. Out of interest, I looked at the state of the school’s website from when I was attending seventh
                        grade. My old school seemed to go through at least three different domains and had multiple domains
                        running in parallel.

                    I remember being taught VBA Basic, HTML with CSS, and using CorelDraw to make graphics for the
                    website. The only other thing I remember is constantly feeling too stupid to program. “I’m not good enough
                    at maths or logical thinking to understand what happens when I type things into the computer.” I was so
                    happy once this course was over, and at that point, it was very clear to me that I was just too stupid to do
                    anything with the web and coding in general. Looking back on this episode of my life and reevaluating this,
                    I can see that is not true at all. <br>

                    <span class="indent"></span>
                    Berlin had a school reform in 2003, which mandated that every school had to have a focus. Our
                    school chose a media focus and had to scramble together an informatics teacher and a course. We were the 
                    <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040208140124/http://www.lilienthal-og.de:80/seiten/ITG/itg.html" target="_blank">second year</a> 
                    where this course was thought, so everything was still pretty rough. If
                    I remember correctly, the guy who taught us was also the web admin for the school website and not a regular
                    teacher at my school. With me now having been part of a few coding workshops and gaining some teaching
                    experience, I realize that this whole course was not a good way to introduce new students to coding. So, all
                    in all, many different random factors came together. My first year in a new school environment, me being a
                    very angsty and sensitive kid, a school reform that introduced the <em>Informationstechnischer
                    Grundkurs</em> the year before, and we were still being guinea pigs for this new curriculum. <br>

                    <span class="indent"></span>
                    After this somewhat traumatic first encounter with code, I was convinced I was too stupid to code
                    because it’s something only smart or STEM people can do—which sadly is a widespread belief held by people
                    inside and outside the coding field. Although I was socialized as a boy and was a somewhat geeky teen, which
                    was at least stereotypically a prerequisite for becoming part of the coding subculture, I never became a
                    part of it and developed in a different direction.

                    Besides fear, the bad vibes I felt as a teen were another significant factor in why I never really
                    became part of the male-dominated geek culture. Later, I would learn the concepts to understand what these
                    bad vibes were—sexism, elitism, racism, anti-queerness, toxic masculinity, to name a few. I was mainly on
                    Tumblr but occasionally visited places like <em>Something Awful</em> or <em>4chan</em> to see what was
                    happening in the abyss. When <em>Gamergate</em> happened in 2014, the hate reached my bubble of depressed,
                    internet-obsessed, queer young adults on Tumblr almost instantly and radicalized me in my beliefs. Since
                    then, I had a somewhat split perception of the Internet. I was part of heavily online communities that could
                    make their own Internet to a certain degree, even if that was impossible for me personally. <span class="comment-link c5"></span>
                    With the preconception that many people who could make websites or the Internet at large were part of a
                    group of people I was at odds with and my general fear of code, the idea of making the Internet was very far
                    away. Yet, I ended up coding and love making websites.

                    With my coding skills improving over the last two years, <span class="comment-link c6"></span> I’m now at the point where I have somewhat of a praxis or at least ideas about what I am
                    doing with the medium website, how I am engaging with it, and what I want to do with it moving forward. For
                    me personally, this has had an impact on the way I program, albeit subconsciously until recently. While
                    searching for a topic for my thesis, I began realizing that many of the things I’m drawn to in coding are,
                    in a way, a reconciliation with past fears of my childhood self. <span class="comment-link c7"></span> <br>

                    I like websites with a certain warm feeling—a sort of personal character. This can apply to design
                    and content, as well as to code or how they were made. The aspect of how it’s made started to become more
                    pronounced the more I could code. With this, I also realized I wanted the code side of the website to have a
                    warm and inviting feeling, as this was something I had feared and distanced myself from for such a long
                    time.

                    Most websites I visit outside big platforms, like social media or video streaming services, are
                    made by a single person or a tiny group of people. I enjoy getting to know these strangers, who also like
                    making websites just by visiting the spaces they created. So, I want the same to be true when someone visits
                    one of the websites I made. When I leave or encounter messages, notes, explanations, or other artifacts in
                    the code of a website, they are comments. It’s one of the few ways to leave text in code that is not code
                    itself. So, over the last few years, the comment grew very close to my heart, and in a way, I’m dedicating
                    this text to you, dear comment. To get to know you better, understand you more, learn about your history,
                    how you’re used, and what you mean to me. So I welcome you, dear reader, to go on this journey with me.
