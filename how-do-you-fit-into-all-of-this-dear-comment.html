                        The comment, I think, is one way that helps set up places like these. It is a tool for
                        communication, and I want to embrace this. Be it to write to myself, collaborators, or others who see the
                        website. From what I experienced while browsing and writing comments, they can take many different shapes.
                        I‘ll try to organize my impressions into a few <em>aspects</em> to better describe what I see in these different
                        types of comments. However, I don‘t understand them as selective categories; rather, they are overlapping
                        fields where a comment can have one or multiple aspects.

                        The first and most common type is the <em>aspect of explanation</em>. This type of comment is all about
                        describing the code's functionality in a short, clear, and impersonal manner. From my experience, this is
                        also what is used most by the coding community and is generally understood as a comment. When scrolling
                        through Reddit and other forums, as well as skimming over good practice advice, this is what I see most
                        often as the canonized comment, with many debates over what a good or a bad comment is. I imagine scenarios
                        where code is commented on in preparation for a hand-off between developers or while trying to organize the
                        contributions of many people more efficiently. I somewhat see Knuth‘s ideal of literate programming in this
                        aspect, as it also focuses on explaining code. To a certain degree, it’s good practice to describe your code
                        with comments. However, it’s something that programmers seem to do afterward and to a lesser degree than
                        they would like to in theory.<sup class="footnote-link">83</sup> This also explains to me
                        why the more elaborate and work-intensive ways of commenting, like literate programming, never caught on.
                        The way current large language models<sup class="footnote-link">84</sup> comment code also falls for
                        me in this aspect, as they can only reproduce the status quo. Acknowledging this status quo, I think it‘s
                        good that it is now possible to make written code more understandable by including automatically generated
                        documentation. Looking back at the history of code and computing, this way of engaging with the comment and
                        code in general stays in the confines of the masculine-coded programming tradition. Even with an outlier
                        like literate programming, this aspect has an underlying motive of efficiency and rationality. Code has to
                        be commented on to streamline the working processes. I see this aspect in a continuous struggle to find a
                        balance between writing and not writing comments to maximize efficiency and, by proxy, profit. Further
                        automating this time-consuming process of commenting in a standardized way using large language models seems
                        to solve this struggle in the near future.

                        Initially, I still had a way of thinking about comments and code that tended to label them as good
                        and bad to a certain extent. The more I looked into the topic, the more I realized that the debate and
                        evaluation between good and bad is not particularly helpful. It‘s so shaped by historically grown values
                        that classification is not practical for me, as nearly everything that is important to me in comments exists
                        in opposition to efficiency, productivity, and impersonality.</p>

                        Re-examining the <em>aspect of explanation</em> outside the bounds of efficiency, the key function of
                        explaining code stays the same, but the goal can change. A website can become a repository of knowledge and
                        a learning tool for others that is more accessible and understandable than just code. In that way, I
                        resonate with Knuth’s idea of literate programming, but more in the sense of taking the time to think and
                        reflect about how to communicate what code does in a way that prioritizes the human reading it. I also see
                        the opportunity for citation or referring to others to build a network of references and relations to other
                        people and websites, embedding it into a contemporary period of web-making.</p>

                        For me, the <em>aspect of the archive</em> represents the contextualization of present and unused code, as
                        well as existing, unutilized, or even rejected features. So, writing about everything that is present,
                        commented out, or not in the code anymore. Reflecting on decisions, recoding processes, documenting features
                        that never came to be, mourning parts that no longer exist, treasuring drafts, and imagining alternative
                        paths. I think of this aspect as a personal interpretation of version control on the website itself.

                        Moving beyond code itself, I want to talk more about the more personal aspects of commenting—the
                        aspects of relation and intimacy. The <em>aspect of relation</em> represents comments that establish connections
                        between me and something or someone else and position my work in larger or specific contexts that are
                        important to me. I see them as ways to express inspiration, write about references, refer to ideas,
                        recommend something, or share a fascination. The <em>aspect of intimacy</em> is all about emotions, thoughts, and
                        opinions. Reminiscing about moments of joy, voicing struggles, hardships, and frustrations, telling an
                        in-joke or sharing a secret, holding on to fleeting thoughts, and sharing some gossip. They are the records
                        of day-to-day life while working on a website, little artifacts of moods—a sort of diary.

                        The <em>aspect of worldbuilding</em> represents narrative elements and storytelling. I consider this
                        aspect, to a certain extent, as an inversion of the <em>aspect of intimacy</em>, as it builds a fictional character
                        that takes the place of the person making the website. Depictions of this could be websites as entities or
                        characters serving as the main focal point of personal interaction and relation. I imagine narratives
                        unfolding as a website grows older, gets updated, or certain milestones are achieved. Mixing storytelling
                        and role play with the making, maintaining, and updating a website.

                        Last, I want to talk about the <em>aspect of ornamentation</em>, which embodies the urge to decorate and
                        organize. Even though it is not a comment, I would include the general shape of the web code in this aspect.
                        For example, the stylistic choices made for indenting, line width, breaks or white space, and layout in
                        general. This can also include considerations about the web code's general structure. Are different parts of
                        code treated like chapters, or are certain parts of the CSS and JavaScript split between multiple files for
                        specific purposes? Returning to the comment itself, I see it as a blank canvas for custom lettering,
                        headlines, spacers, separation lines, illustrations, and many more forms of ASCII art—playing with the
                        textual nature of code and subverting it. I see the <em>aspect of ornamentation</em> as an extension of the website’s
                        design permeating through all layers of the website, as well as a graphical layer that can be used to deepen
                        other aspects.

                            This last paragraph started as a comment, but I think it works better in the main text, even
                            if it’s a bit scatterbrained? But just now, I was thinking about male living spaces and how they are
                            often somewhat sad or awful places to exist in. Scrolling through <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/malelivingspace/" target="_blank">r/malelivingspace</a> is a very
                            sobering experience for me, with only a few outliers. When looking at these sad, for me, very
                            cis-male-coded living spaces, I kind of get the same vibes as when looking at desolate web code.

                        All of these aspects exist outside the scope of writing functional code for a website to be
                        performed. They are bridges enabling connections to other practices, which are able to enrich the experience
                        of creating web code and interacting with environments of web code. I see comments as ways to relate to and
                        reflect on the code I write. With my now better understanding of the history of code, I also feel the
                        responsibility to critically engage with this part of my craft in an ongoing way—and why not visibly in the
                        documents and websites I create. For me, a part of this is making my code understandable and relatable to
                        non-programmers as well. In this, I align with many aspects of Bajohr and Krajewski‘s concept of Source code
                        Criticism from the perspective of a person who writes code. Code in itself should be something that should
                        be primarily written with human readers in mind. In source code criticism, the focus is more on analyzing
                        algorithms and more complex code than on the websites I make. Nevertheless, I think that the approach of
                        contextualizing web code as it is created and placing our actions in a larger context also makes sense for
                        websites. On the one hand, with a view to all the people who visit the website in the present; on the other
                        hand, with a view to the future and the possibility that the website could still be available in some form
                        in archives or databases many years from now. When I search on the WaybackMachine myself, I wish I could
                        find something additional on many websites that would tell me more about the context and the moment in which
                        the website exists or about the people who made it. In the research for this thesis, I could only learn more
                        about the background by reading interviews or memoirs; I wish this had also been possible on the websites
                        themselves.<span class="comment-link c23"></span>

                        Recently, I started watching Cory Archangel‘s <a href="https://rhizome.org/editorial/artbase-anthologies-002/"
                        target="_blank">Let’s Play Majerus G3</a>. It‘s part artwork and research into the late painter Michel
                    Majerus‘ restored laptop. Majerus used his computer in nearly all aspects of his working process as it was
                    an extension of his studio into the digital. Archangel shares insights about Majerus‘s practice by exploring
                    this digital working environment and explores how artists‘ use of digital tools could have shaped their
                    work. Following this deep dive into Majerus‘ works left me wondering about artists or designers working
                    exclusively with digital media or net art websites. Relating my own practice to this, I‘m wondering how much
                    my laptop would say and how much is already inside the website—as I see it as a working environment
                    supported by my code editor of choice. Using the analogy of the studio to reflect on the dual nature of
                    object and process in websites. Here, the website as the object would be the artwork, and the website as the
                    process would be the studio. In this sense, it feels weird to me that I am artificially cleaning my studio
                    afterward or trying to use my studio space without leaving any traces behind. I see it as a somewhat magical
                    property of websites that I can leave my whole studio within them. I‘m also realizing now why I think of
                    websites in terms of spaces or a place. Using the metaphor of studio, I now start to understand why it‘s
                    also so important to me to make these spaces nice and warm, as they are places I inhabit or inhabited.
                    Looking at my physical desk right now, I‘m in front of my laptop, surrounded by my notes, different pens,
                    snacks, tea, and plants, while my diffusor spreads bergamot fragrance. Of course, this also carries over
                    into my digital working environments.</p>

                        But building these personal spaces and sharing them with others somehow exudes an aura of
                        unprofessionalism. I associate this link between personal web space and this perceived lack of
                        professionalism with the commercialization of the web in the 2000s and the entry into the era of Web 2.0.

                        this professionalism expresses itself in terms of writing web code in code that is clean, efficient, and
                        detached from the person writing it, as it is soaked in the conventions that established themselves
                        throughout the history of coding. There is no room for the playful, the expressive, the opinionated, the
                        relational, the personal. I see it as a way to erase the people working on web code, as well as their
                        spaces. It hides the diverse voices, perspectives, and histories behind a veil of professionalism, further
                        upholding the problematic web-making values.

                        I think it‘s important to rethink what professionalism means and how this social code shapes what
                        we do. It‘s not that I want to go back to yellow Comic Sans on a light green background, but I think it‘s
                        important to reconsider where the web came from, where it will go, and what influence we have. The current
                        values of professionalism regarding web code and the histories of code and web are deeply entangled in
                        capitalist and patriarchal structures. As a result, I see how we tend to make the web as fundamentally in
                        conflict with the effort and care it takes to set up these places through comments. In this sense,
                        commenting could also be understood as a form of care within the framework of technofeminist theory.
                        Commenting as a form of work within programming that is geared towards enabling access and participation for
                        others—to care for those visiting and to make those who make the web more visible. I see them as an
                        opportunity to reflect on and change how and for whom we write web code. More than just displaying the code
                        of a website through view source, comments can make this part of a website into a more inviting
                        space—working against the prejudice of who should have access to these spaces. Similar to feminist
                        hackerspaces, I see the opportunity for websites to be places of learning, questioning, and sharing what it
                        means to engage with the technologies we use.<sup class="footnote-link">86</sup> In
                        this sense, comments can create spaces of critique, rethinking, and resistance - not as a singular solution
                        but as one of many possibilities to critically engage with the historically grown structures of our practice
                        as web makers.

                        So we need you, dear comment, to carry them—as web code is not yet able to carry these criticisms
