<!-- 
    To be honest, I was sure that I would write more things while trying to figure out how I want this website to be. But with all the
    content (thesis) already there it was a pretty streamlined process of writing the html. Exporting everything from Obsidian to html 
    and cleaning it up made the whole process very quck. I knew already from my very first draft, that I wanted to have a lot of
    marginal space for all the comments and footnotes. I also wanted to use some restrictions for this website. One of them was css name
    colors only, which was a very fun experience, and forced me to learn some new things. The second (maybe weird) choice was to use html tables. 
    Some time ago while at work for my student job I had to figure out some problems with a newsletter tool and leard that emails basically
    only use tables for layouting, because a lot of css things are just not working with emails. Looking through all the html code of these 
    emails was interesting, as this felt like clash of ages. A newsletter service, with modern build your own website~like tools, shoehoring
    everything into html tables, because of the restrictions emails have.
        As I have never really worked with tables before and was interested in "misusing" it a least one time, I decided this was the time. 
    I think display grid would have also worked. But I still think the base stucture of the html would have been similar to what I ended up
    with using the table. I like that comments, footnotes and text are pretty close together in the html and not split up. With the first
    export from obsidian everything was very disconnected.
        Still one thing that is kind of sad (but okay) is that my idea of one table row per paragraph really did not work out at all. 
    I wanted the text to be without any longer breaks between paragraphs, but sometimes my comments or footnotes were way longer than the
    the current paragraph of text – so a table would always have the height of the longest element. With this I had to cheat a bit and
    put as many paragraphs in one row as it needed to be the longest element in the row.
