                        I like the definition of a comment in Markus Krajewski’s text <em>Kulturtechnik
                        Programmieren</em>, as it is close to how I feel about it. He talks about the two layers of code. The
                        first layer is the instructions, which are executed by the machine. This is the actual code or text written
                        in a programming language. The second layer is marked text that is not executed. This piece of text is
                        ignored by the machine.&NoBreak;<sup class="footnote-link">2</sup> It can be text, code, a mix,
                        or something like ASCII art. Either way, it does not matter to the machine but to us as readers. To make a
                        comment or mark text so it will not be executed, you will have to use a specific string of symbols to let
                        the program know what follows will be a comment. Here is a small example with HTML.&NoBreak;<sup class="footnote-link">3</sup>

                        There are two ways to format a comment: block and inline. A block comment is comparable to a
                        paragraph of text with one or multiple line breaks. This would be used for a longer comment. Compared to
                        this, an inline comment is shorter and spans only one line. Here is a quick example of those two types of
                        comments.
                        
                        <code class="code-block">&lt;p&gt;dear reader&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!-- What follows is an inline comment in the same line--&gt;</code>

In the case of HTML, it can be a bit confusing because there is no difference in the symbols used to signify whether it’s an inline or a block comment. --&gt;</code>

                        as its sort of programming language. The comments I am writing inside
                        Obsidian are declared by typing <code>%%</code>. All the text that follows will be treated as a comment.
                        To close it and return to the regular text, I must type <code>%%</code> again.

                        Either way, even though the way to mark a text as a comment differs for many programming
                        languages, the functions stay the same. The one I want to focus on is communicating something that is
                        intended for human readers.&NoBreak;<sup class="footnote-link">5</sup> As something that seems
                        trivial but has been picked up repeatedly by different authors, the code has a certain duality to it.<sup class="footnote-link">6</sup> 
                        It is read by humans as well as machines. More specifically,

                        machines. This raises the question of who we are writing code for: machine or human? It may seem like we are
                        writing code for the machine to tell it what to do, but are we really? I like how Vikram Chandra puts Donald
                        Knuth’s struggle with this question in Geek Sublime.

                        5 Of course, there are many potential uses of a comment besides communication. One that comes to
                        mind is commenting out code. If the goal is to have a piece of code not perform while still
                        keeping it, the code can be put in a comment. In a way, this code is stored in a state of limbo,
                        hidden from the machine, but maybe also not that relevant to the human reader.

                        6 In a way, all of this can probably be traced back to the seminal book <em>The Art of
                        Programming</em> by Donald Knuth. A lot of the texts I read trace this statement back to
                        Knuth.

                        Knuth, a big proponent of writing code meant to be read and understood by humans, coined the term
                        <em>literate programming</em> in his 1984 paper and later, in 1992, wrote a book about it. In his case, he
                        advocated for code as a form of discourse between people—the coder as writer and essayist. For Knuth, code
                        should be clear, legible, and communicate its function. Additionally, all the code should be documented in a
                        way that explains how exactly the code works in an elaborate literary way.<sup class="footnote-link">9</sup> 
                        He suggests writing code so that big parts of the code are
                        only important to the human reader, not the performing machine. An excerpt from Ross Williams sums this up

                            program code are comments which describe the various parts of the code. In literate programming the
                            emphasis is reversed. Instead of writing code containing documentation, the literate programmer writes

                        The focus is on the human. The comment is one way to achieve this programming paradigm, as it has
                        a singular human audience. Knuth went down his own rabbit hole with this and created a whole system to
                        program this way.<sup class="footnote-link">11</sup> This also questions the
                        important part of the code—for Knuth, it’s the comment or the documentation. Similarly, certain currents in
                        literary studies, such as Critical Code Studies or Source Code Criticism, also question this topic. While
                        Critical Code Studies focus more on the meaning and implications of code in terms of the social context
                        <sup class="footnote-link">12</sup>, Source Code Criticism is more about developing and
                        generating an understanding of code by enriching the code with knowledge about its origin, function and
                        context.<sup class="footnote-link">13</sup> Bajohr and Krajewski’s take
                        on Source Code Criticism is that the comment is a central tool for documenting and explaining code for
                        further study without interrupting the aspect of the machine performing the code.<sup class="footnote-link">14</sup> 
                        This way of thinking about the relation between code and
                        comment really resonates with me. Going into this text, I had some of my own ideas about the relation
                        between code and comment, and it’s always nice to realize there were others before me who also thought about
                        this. <span class="comment-link c10"></span> Everything is so relational—Code or writing, it always happens on
                        the back of others who came before me. Quoting other writing, copying code others have written, writing
                        notes, and writing comments. While writing this text, there is a multitude of different annotations, like my
                        personal notes, all the comments, and footnotes. I’m wondering what the important part is—my writing,
                        personal anecdotes, or the original texts of others I refer to in the footnotes, with this text being a kind
                        of fluff piece to contain them. What is the central or essential part of the writing, and what should be
                        highlighted?

                        <a href="https://tug.org/whatis.html" target="_blank">TeX</a>, a
                        typesetting system because he was unhappy with digital type settings at that time, which then
                        led him to create MetaFont to make fonts look good in TeX. Two examples of literate programming
                        are Kuth‘s publications <em class="not-source">The TeXbook</em> and <em class="not-source">The METAFONTbook</em>, both of which used
                        web WEB and TeX in the process.

                        Approaching this from the position of a graphic designer, there is also always a decision to be
                        made about the importance of the running text and everything adjacent to it. What are the relations between
                        the font sizes, how much space will I give footnotes on a page, will they be part of the margin or the
                        running text, and how big will I make the margin? Thinking about the aesthetics of the very traditional ways
                        of book setting from the Middle Ages or the more modern formalized constructions of the print area from the
                        likes of Jan Tschichold, they seem to me like there is an emphasis on big margins.</p>

                        Going back to how it came to this specific topic, I
                        think my talks with Polina about websites, making websites, and the poetic web are factors why I decided
                        to write about this topic. I have been interested in comments for a long time. I was also looking at
                        source code to find comments, but talking to Polina before and after their 
                        <a href="https://words-on-margins.website/" target="_blank">workshop</a> about
                        the topic of code marginalia was the last push that made me decide to also take a deeper look at
                        comments and what they mean for me.

                        Apart from the arguments on aesthetics, there is plenty of space for notes. To me, these gestures
                        emphasize commenting, taking notes, or writing your own thoughts in a book that has the physical space for
                        it.<sup class="footnote-link">15</sup> In short, there is a lot of
                        space for marginalia—all the sorts of things that are happening in the margins of a book.<sup class="footnote-link">16</sup> 
                        I like that marginalia are a somewhat open space for what
                        they can be. Everything that happens in the margins or outside of the print area is available for anyone—a
                        sort of free commons on the book page. This feeling does not translate one-to-one for me when going from
                        writing to coding—or a text editor to a coding environment. All of these thoughts of footnotes, quotes,
                        annotations, and marginalia meld together into a comment—or more like they all exist in the space between
                        the opening and closing string of a comment. Although I included marginalia into this space, that is, the
                        comment out of all of the forms of different annotations, marginalia feels closest to comments in terms of
                        openness—as comments, as well as marginalia, can be pretty open spaces in terms of what happens inside them.
                        This also brings me to the title of this thesis <em>Code Marginalia</em>. For me, marginalia serves
                        primarily as a lens through which to view comments, to figure out what they are, how to approach them, and
                        how to connect them to other forms of annotation. This title and topic are also in relation to the ongoing
                        research <a href="https://kimkleinert.com/" target="_blank">Kim Kleinert</a> and

                        15 Looking deeper into this relationship between our relationship to books, how we use them, and how
                        margins evolved in modern typesetting or printmaking is a rabbit hole I will not go down, but
                        I‘m curious what kind of relationships could be uncovered.

                        16 As for how to define marginalia, there is the 
                        <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/marginalia" target="_blank">Merriam Webster definition of marginalia</a>: 1.&nbsp;
                        <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/marginal" target="_blank">marginal</a>&nbsp;
                        notes or embellishments (as in a book) 2.&nbsp;nonessential items. As it is with marginalia, this dual definition also feels like a
                        good fit for comments. As a side note: I also really like the definition of the 
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginalia" target="_blank">english Wikipedia Article on Marginalia </a> 
                        as it includes links to all the different forms of graphical elements
                        (embellishments in the Merriam Webster definition) like doodles or drolleries. There is also
                        this really nice <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skUs534pBj4" target="_blank">Interview from the State Library of Victoria about Marginalia</a> that sums
                        up what marginalia are and also shows some nice examples.

                        To better understand where comments are coming from, I would like to take a closer look at the
                        history of comments and coding in general. But I also want to take a short detour and glance at the history
                        of marginalia.
